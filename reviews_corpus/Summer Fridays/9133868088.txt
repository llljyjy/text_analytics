I hate when I find an expensive product that’s literally the best of all time, but here we are, I am hooked on this lip balm! When I finally caved and bought it, I was having the worst dry lips of my life after starting a pretty aggressive acne medication, and no lip balm could make them feel better. That’s when I took a chance on summer Fridays lip balm, and oh my gosh. When you put it on, it’s the smoothest, buttery-est thing ever and gives you a gorgeous glossy sheen that lasts longer than most lip flosses. It doesn’t take long to start making your lips unchapped and smooth as can be. It’s also a great overnight lip mask, because it does its magic the entire night. I wake in the morning with plenty of products still sitting on my lips, which is important to me because most lip balms I apply the night before leave my lips fending for themselves and dry again by the time I wake up. I’m afraid to inform my wallet that I will be repurchasing this product many times over, and I recommend that others try it. A Holy Grail Lip Balm!
