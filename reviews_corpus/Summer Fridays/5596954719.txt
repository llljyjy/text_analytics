I recieve the Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm in Vanilla complimentary from Summer Fridays. The balm is extra hydrating for the lips. The lip balm can also bebuse as a lip mask for overnight treatment. I like the applicator which has a silicon tip to make it easy to glide on my lips. I can tell how moisturizing and soft my lips feels after applying. I had really chapped and wind burn lips and I recieve much relief and softness to my lips. I love the vanilla scent which smells nice and subtle. Softer Lips after one Application
