I will confess, I am a lip balm addict. I have tried hundreds of lip products. This is decent, but by no means is it anything special. Smell is pleasant and subtle, and gives a nice sheen to the lips without being goopy or tacky. With that being said, I applied it several nights in a row and my lips were no better off in the morning than when I don’t apply anything…I enjoy the silicone applicator, but would not repurchase. On to the next… On to the next…
