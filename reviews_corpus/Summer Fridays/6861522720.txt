it’s very rare for me to use a product and instantly see results but this serum was one of those things. it combines so many of my absolute favourite ingredients into one serum. my only complaint is that it’s only 30mL so you will go through it quicker. ive noticed such a difference in how supple and hydrated my skin looks. an absolute must in my routine! a forever staple
