It’s very beautiful on the lips I have VanillaBeige and I have neutral light skin and a little goes a long way. It’s a Balm but can turn into a glossier finish if you add more to lips. Very hydrating and very natural and give my lips a very hydrating contoured lips and long lasting. It’ll last you a while too so definitely recommend and the scent isn’t overwhelming it’s more like a sweet cupcake treat while applying but scent doesn’t last very long which is good. Please make more shades and scents this formula is beautiful and travel friendly for smaller purses ;) P.s it’s VEGAN for people who are very strict about cosmetic products that are cruelty free :) Holy grail
