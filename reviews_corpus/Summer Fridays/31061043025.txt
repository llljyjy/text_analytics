Iâ€™m in my 20s and a good hydration is everything I want from an eye cream. The challenge is my under eye area is pretty sensitive and reacts to most skincare products but fortunately not this one. Fragrance free formula of this eye cream feels very gentle and well hydrating while also providing nice brightening effect. The shiny particles add beautiful luminosity to the skin and look natural at the same time. 5 stars overall! Great for sensitive skin
