This is probably one of the best lip products I’ve ever purchased for myself. I just recently found out about this brand through an ad on instagram and it immediately caught my attention considering I’m a huge fan of keeping my lips constantly glossed and moisturized. It blends in with my natural lip color and ever since I’ve purchased these I’ve made sure that I never leave my house without them. I adore how yummy it smells and the application is so incredibly smooth. I’m also a big fan of vegan cosmetics, so consider me a valued costumer for life! Thank you so much summer fridays, I look forward to trying all of your products <3 i adore these lip butters !
