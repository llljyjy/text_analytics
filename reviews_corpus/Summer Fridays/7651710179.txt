I’m super obsessed with this! Firstly, the packaging is stunning and I love the pump bottle. The serum is more of a gel serum consistency which I like because it’s not sticky like other hyaluronic acid serums can tend to be. It melts right into the skin. I’m thankful it is like a gel consistency because I can use it in the morning with my combo skin and not worry about it being too heavy under my make up. I do see a boost of hydration in the morning. Plus it has my favorite ingredient colloidal oatmeal (and others like tiger grass) to help reduce redness which I see with a lot. The perfect serum!
