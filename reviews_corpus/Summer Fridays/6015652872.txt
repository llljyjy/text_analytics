I really enjoy this oil. I’ve used it in both my morning and night routine and have always been satisfied with the results. Super hydrating but doesn’t leave my skin feeling “too greasy”. I think that’s awesome because I also have combination skin. This brand is one of my favorites for skincare needs works great
