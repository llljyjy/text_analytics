I wish I could give 0 stars.  Such a let down. I love their heavenly sixteen oil. Maybe I misunderstood this product but I thought it would be a nice moisturizing mask to recover from a peel or retinol but I agree with what others said, it melted my skin and I broke out, just so reactive for sensitive skin. Lots of folks say it reacts with this or that but a quality product should be stable, there are many recovery serums and masks that can be used with retinol, ahas, bhas, niacinamide, etc. so yeah if you use nothing go for it. The majority of the good reviews are incentivized. This is garbage. Caution, not for sensitive skin!
