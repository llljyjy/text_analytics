I received this lip balm complimentary from Summer Fridays for my honest review . This lip balm from Summer  Fridays is so hydrating . It feels so nourishing on my lips . Glides on smoothly and last a long time before reapplying. I highly recommend trying this lip balm . It has a slight scent of vanilla. Hydrating lip balm .
