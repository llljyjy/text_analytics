Honestly- why did I wait for so long before buying this? Although I’m glad I did because the original packaging isn’t something that looks great. This product is AMAZING and worth it. It’s just thick enough without being too thick, light vanilla smell is heavenly, lasts forever on the lips and feels hydrating. And the applicator is amazing, props to whoever designed it because it’s the best balm applicator I’ve ever tried (and I have a lip product addiction). It hugs your lips and glides so nicely. Buy it! Why did I wait so long to try?
