I was advised to skip the pigmented ones with these, and I’m glad I did. I love the formulation, and it feels so nice to use, but I can see how the pigment would end up outside your lip line after a couple hours of wear. It’s lovely for every day use, but if feels lux enough to give as a gift. I’ll repurchase for sure. Delightful All Around
