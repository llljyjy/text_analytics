I bought this because it was super hyped and I was very excited about this color! The first few uses there wasn’t a tint to what was coming out, but after I got past that the color is beautiful! The plumping factor was shocking to me. My only qualm is that it doesn’t last very long after applying and leaves my lips feeling a little dry after. Beautiful color!
