I’ve been using this eye cream for about 2 weeks now and while I can’t say it has made my under eyes lighter yet, it is a very hydrating cream. I have sensitive skin and so far it hasn’t  caused any irritation. I also love the way that it adds an immediate glow right after application and it doesn’t cause my makeup to look weird after applying like some eye creams do. Overall I think this is a great product worth trying! nan
