Obsessed with this product. Soooooo hydrating and a little goes a long way. I never tried Summer Friday’s products and now I’m hooked. I have pretty dry lips so I am constantly applying lip balm throughout the day. This is one of the best lip products I have every used. It melts right into my lips and keeps them so soft. It’s so moisturizing, smells great like Vanilla, is thick and kind of waxy, good size tube for the money. I would definitely recommend this! Totally obsessed!!
