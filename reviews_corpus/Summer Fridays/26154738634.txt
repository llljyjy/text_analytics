This serum is so hydrating and nourishing! My skin soaks it up. Leaves my skin feeling plump and silky, soft. It’s fragrance free but I noticed a light scent when applying but it went away after a few minutes. Has a thick consistency compared to other hydrating serums. However, it doesn’t feel heavy or tacky on the skin and it absorbs quickly. Overall, I really enjoyed Dream Oasis. Works well with my other skincare products.  Love the ingredients and results from it. Hydrating Dream Serum
