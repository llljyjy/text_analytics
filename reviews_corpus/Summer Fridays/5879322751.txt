Mediocre eye cream. It does brighten, I noticed my under eye area has improved brightness. I think the tiny does assist for an immediate result. I personally don’t mind the tint. I have extremely dry under eyes and eyelids and found this provided no significant hydration. The biggest drawback to this, why i am rating 3 stars, is that it pills. Even on days I don’t wear makeup, it pills. Bad. It might be due to too much product that doesn’t absorb but I use less than a dime size for both eyes and it still pills. I would not repurchase or recommend for anyone with sensitive or dry eyes. No Hydration, pills
