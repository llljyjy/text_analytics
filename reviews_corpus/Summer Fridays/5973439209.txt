I’m pretty disappointed with this product. It’s thick, so I felt like it was going to be really good as I was planning on using this as my nighttime moisturizer but it really doesn’t do the job of hydrating... at all. My skin feels tights after it dries and like it still needs more hydration. And the price isn’t cheap for how bad it is...I will not be buying again. I’ve been layering this under Vaseline (that slugging trend) which helps immensely. I even used a large amount of it once thinking that would help but it didn’t and even if it did, it wouldn’t be worth using that much for how fast it would go out. Def save your money on this one, unless you can sample it No hydration whatsoever
