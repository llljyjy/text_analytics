Hydrating, brightening and smoothing-- What more can i say! This SF eye cream is the real deal and I can’t rave about it enough. I use it after washing my face and applying toner (day and night) and I love the glow it gives under my eyes. It creates a creaseless and hydrated base under concealer as well. A little goes a long way so it’s a ton of product too! What we all have been waiting for!
