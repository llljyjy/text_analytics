I’m 33 years old and have been using this eye cream consistently for over a week now. I was hoping to see noticeable results as far as brightness and de-puffing. I plan on continuing application to see if my skin just needs more time to adjust. I do love the consistency. It’s slightly shimmery giving you an instant ’glow’ after application. I love so many other Summer Friday products especially their Soft Rest exfoliant and Jet Lag Mask so I really wanted to love this product. 3 stars or me compared to their other amazing products! Good, but not great!
