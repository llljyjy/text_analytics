I was gifted by Summer Fridays, so here are my first impressions! The texture of the serum is very smooth and silky. I find that some hydrating serums either soak into your skin way too fast, or take forever to be absorbed, and I feel like this serum absorbed perfectly. It is pretty lightweight so it’s perfect for summer, but it still did a great job at making my skin feel hydrated. My skin (especially around my nose) has been super dry and red, and I was worried that this could irritate my dryness, but it is soothed my redness — so far this serum has been very good for my sensitive skin. Additionally, I love that there is no sticky residue, or noticeable fragrance! Ultimately, I think this serum is super perfect for my summer dry patches! Perfect hydrating serum for the summer!
