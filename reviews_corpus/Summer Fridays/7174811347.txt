I use 2 pumps of this serum on my damp face day and night and it has made such a big difference I even noticed long term effects on my skin. It stays very well hydrated and even the texture looks better! I would definitely buy it again. The texture is very light and it feels very refreshing My skin is not like the Sahara desert anymore!
