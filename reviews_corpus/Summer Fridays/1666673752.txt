My go-to vitamin c serum! At first, I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not this product would be effective. It actually quickly became my favorite vit c, and I’ve gone through 4 bottles since then. It plays well with the rest of my skincare regimen, is hydrating, and very gentle. I use it everyday, including on nights I’m not using retinol. In regards to reviews on pilling - I’ve experienced far worse with other brands. If ever thats an issue with a certain moisturizer, I just make sure to wait until the serum dries down before moving onto the next step. nan
