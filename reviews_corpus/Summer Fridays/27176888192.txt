I don’t really understand all the negative reviews saying it pilled and left an orange cast and was too sparkly?? I haven’t noticed any of those things, what I have noticed is that it sinks into the skin no problem and makes my under eyes brighter. Only giving 4 stars for now because I’ve only been using for maybe 5 days but so far I like it and could see myself buying another. I’m not sure what happened with other people but I have no problem wearing this alone or under makeup. Give it a try. so far so good!
