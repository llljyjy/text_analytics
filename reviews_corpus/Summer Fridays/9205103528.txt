My skin has been so dry lately and I am so shocked that this serum calmed my skin and helped heal dry patches so quickly. Itâ€™s a really milky texture, thicker than my other hydrating serums but not yet a moisturizer. No pilling with any other products so far. Makes my skin feel soft and supple! really nice for the price imo
