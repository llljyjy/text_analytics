This is my go to moisturizer after a particularly trying or traveling work week. It is a bit thick so I use it as a before bed treatment and I wake up to a plump moisturized face.  It gives my natural glow back.  I will use this as an under eye treatment when traveling nightly to combat the sunken look when I donâ€™t sleep well in hotels.  I have begun aging and this moisturizer is helping me feel like my face looks young again. nan
