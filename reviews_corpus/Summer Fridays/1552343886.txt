Absolutely LOVE this product. I first discovered this product a couple of years ago. I bought the original Vanilla but I had to throw it away because the tube was always releasing the product, and it would overflow and get sticky. While I feel that maybe there was more product in the old packaging, this new packaging allows for a much better application. Regarding the product, I love the consistency. It leaves my lips feeling smooth and hydrated, not sticky like a lot of other products Iâ€™ve tried. I love the colour of this balm and while the scent is light, it is very pleasant. Will continue to repurchase. My Go-To Lip Balm
