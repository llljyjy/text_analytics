It is very hydrating and instantly brightens the under eye area… However, there is a LOT of glitter in this product. I have used some eye creams with a bit of glitter, but this product has a lot. It seems like it looks very obvious that there is glitter all under my eye (maybe this product would be a nice under eye product before makeup?) If this product had a lot less glitter or none at all, I would like it much better. It would also be nicer for it to be a little lighter, it’s a pretty thick product. There are much better eye creams for a MUCH better price. GLITTER! :/
