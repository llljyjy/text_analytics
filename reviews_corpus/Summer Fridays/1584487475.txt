I have dry lips and boy oh boy does this lip butter balm feel moisturizing! My lips feel instantly more hydrated. I love how it adds a nice bit of shine too, so I can skip the gloss. The balm is not sticky, and is easy apply with the silicone applicator. I also love the vanilla scent, itâ€™s not too much, but just right. Buttery balm!
