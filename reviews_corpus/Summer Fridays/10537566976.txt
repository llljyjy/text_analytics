I honestly don’t get the hype of this lip balm. I have the original vanilla and it’s ok, but that’s it. The consistency is exactly like vaseline, exactly. And that’s what it looks like on your lips, thick and oily. It doesn’t last long and it has no long term benefit. There are so many better options for the price. Skip this. I Don’t Get It . . .
