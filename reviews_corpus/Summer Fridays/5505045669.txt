Wow I was surprised by this for sure. First of all it is a white lotion-like consistency which I wasn’t expecting… usually you hear serum and you think more clear-colored and more watery or gel-like but that isn’t the case for this one. It says you can use it alone or under a moisturizer and wow I did not need another moisturizer after applying it because it’s so hydrating (and that’s saying a lot for me with my super dry skin). I love the ingredients-aloe, oat, squalane… all super great for my dry sensitive skin! I also didn’t feel like I needed a primer before makeup. This gave a nice hydrated base with a slight tackiness which helped my makeup apply and “stick” to my face better. Overall I love this! I wouldn’t call it a serum… I’d call it more of a priming moisturizer, but I am impressed! Amazing! Unlike any other serum
