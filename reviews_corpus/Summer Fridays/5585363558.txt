I am in love with this Summer Fridays lip butter balm. The comfort of the curved tip is SO pleasant and actually helps me evenly apply in a nice, thinner, layer. The formula is comfortable, not sticky, and very hydrating on my dry (and often cracked) lips. The scent is subtle and smells of warm vanilla. I really enjoy using this balm. nan
