I have oily, acne prone skin with uneven texture. I’m also prone to redness. This serum is wonderful. I use it as a moisturizer and it is so hydrating but not greasy. My make up good on nicely and doesn’t feel gross/greasy after a few hours. My skin looks refreshed, calm and glowy. The price is fair for how well it works! It’s a keeper for me. Glow, not greasy
