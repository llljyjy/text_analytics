I bought this mostly because I liked Summer Fridays vitamin C serum and Jet Lag mask and I love this product just as much! It goes on very light and leaves a perfect finish for under makeup or alone. I have combo skin with large pores and I tend to get oily in the t zone throughout the day. Yet if I don’t moisturize I get flaky patches. It was like I couldn’t win. Then this came into my life! It soothes any redness in my skin and gets rid of dry patches. I really like the feel of this moisturizer under foundation! Works great- I’m glad I finally found something for my skin that works! The best moisturizer for my skin type
