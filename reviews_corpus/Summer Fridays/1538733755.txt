I have dry, sensitive skin.  Iâ€™ve used this over a year at night, every other night, alternating with a retinol product.  My skin soaks this in.  The scent is not irritating or overwhelming.  And it helps so much was redness and fine lines.  I have a back-up in the fridge! Loved This for Over a Year
