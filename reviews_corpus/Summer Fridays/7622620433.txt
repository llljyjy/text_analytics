I have acne prone skin and this stuff hasn’t caused any type of reaction and I’ve been using it for over 6 months. It’s great for the days I’m feeling dehydrated or just dry and i really like to use it the day after i use my retinol so add some moisture back into my skin. Overall great product i will define repurchasing over and over again!! Amazing moisturizer
