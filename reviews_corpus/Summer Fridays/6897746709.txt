This is such a good light weight serum/moisturizer for my oily skin. It’s starting to get warmer and my skin is changing and becoming more oily. I love that this is something I can use year round with or without moisturizer. It absorbs really well and leaves my skin super soft and hydrated! I don’t feel sticky when I use this at all!
