Summer Fridays lip balm is my favorite now! I absolutely love the packaging and the tip of the tube. It makes the job so easy. It tastes good and makes my lips smooth and buttery soft. Itâ€™s not sticky at all and the vanilla flavor is very light and not like too much flavory. Highly recommend! Must have!
