I loved the texture of this eye cream. Lightweight not too heavy and a mild scent of greatness. Upon immediate use my under eyes felt instantly moisturized and firm. It took a full week of usage for me to really see the brightening properties enhancing my undereyes and reducing the appearance of dark circles, however  it is worth it. It rubs in nicely and when i wake up in the morning my eyes feel super moisturized, firm and smooth. I love this. Instantly firm and moisturized under eyes
