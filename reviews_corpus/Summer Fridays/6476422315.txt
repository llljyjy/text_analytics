This is the balm that started it all. I literally will never use another lip balm again. The vanilla smell is delightful and not artificial or too sickly sweet. The consistency of the new version is slightly thinner than the older formulation but it isn’t less hydrating. It is less sticky, however, which I appreciate. The one thing I might change is the tube. I think the plastic makes it hard to get every last drop so I end up snipping the end off with scissors and using a q-tip to get the last of the product. Amazing formula but the tube isn’t my favorite
