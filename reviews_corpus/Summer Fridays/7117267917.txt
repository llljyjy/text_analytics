Sunday Riley’s TIDAL water cream is my all-time favorite moisturizer, but it is currently discontinued (SR, if you happen to see this, please, please bring TIDAL back), so I tried the Summer Fridays Cloud Dew after it was recommended by a friend, who also loved TIDAL, and bc the ingredients shared some similarities. For context, I have very sensitive, (often) dry skin and occasionally have eczema flare-ups on my face, particularly around my hairline and corners of my nose. While TIDAL seemed to almost immediately absorb into my skin, moisturizing and leaving a healthy glow without the overly shiny/oily appearance, Cloud Dew felt like it sat on top of my skin and never really absorbed or provided hydration. And, even though my skin never felt truly hydrated after applying Cloud Dew, my face looked SO shiny/oily around an hour after application, and I noticed small clogged pores in my t-zone even thought it’s oil-free (Cloud Dew was the only new product in my skincare rotation when I noticed the clogged pores). I really wished Cloud Dew was the perfect replacement for TIDAL for me, but it, unfortunately, wasn’t a good match for my skin. I do love that Cloud Dew does not have added fragrance and that it did not cause my eczema symptoms to increase, but overall it is not a good match for me. For those who might also be searching for a TIDAL replacement and may have similar skin issues, currently, Tatcha’s Water Cream is the closest substitute for TIDAL that I have found and works beautifully with my skin. Unfortunately, not a match for me :/
