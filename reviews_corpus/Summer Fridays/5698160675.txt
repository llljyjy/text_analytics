i keep this in my bag 24/7! this lip balm is super hydrating & thick, i feels like almost a lip glaze. i love the hint of vanilla, not too overwhelming or sweet. the only reason i took off a star was because i wish it lasted longer for how much this costs- i have to reapply this almost every hour. it’s hydrating though & looks great over lip liner so i’d probably still buy again hydrating but not long lasting
