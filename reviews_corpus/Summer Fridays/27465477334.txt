I tried vanilla beige and it burned my lips but the vanilla one is actually pretty nice. It has a cake batter scent which I don’t mind, and it’s moisturizing enough to stay on your lips for a while. Probably won’t be great as a night treatment (I don’t think it’s heavy enough for that), but a pretty good daytime lip balm. The texture feels similar to Laneige glowy balm but that one has BHT. untinted one is better
