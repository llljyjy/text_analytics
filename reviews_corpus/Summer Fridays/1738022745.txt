I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks and I’m extremely impressed! It works well as an AM or PM night cream. In the morning I love the color of it which really brightens my eye area and preps it for concealer. It doesn’t pill with makeup like many eye creams do, it’s also rich enough as an evening cream. My eye area is super sensitive and it’s not at all irritating. Amazing AM or PM eye cream
