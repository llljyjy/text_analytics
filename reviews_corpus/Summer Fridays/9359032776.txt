Gifted by Summer Fridays! I actually received this product in the morning, and already tried it in my morning routine, so here’s what I think, the texture is a little bit sticky, I like the fact that it almost doesn’t smell like anything, and it leaves my skin feeling supple and soft, probably not the most hydrating serum I’ve ever tried, but it does feel nice and luxurious and it gets the job done! nan
