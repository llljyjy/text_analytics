This is the best face mask I have ever used. Was a little turned off by the price, but I am so happy splurged. I used to use the Frank Body glow mask and itâ€™s hydrating, but would break me out. This is like the perfect heavy duty moisturizer that you can use daily and still not break out, or as a added hydration boost every other day. Must have for Canadian winters. nan
