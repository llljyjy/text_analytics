I received this serum complimentary from Summer Fridays.This is a very nice lightweight serum that provides my skin with the right amount of hydration. It has a beautiful silky, smooth texture and it glides right onto my skin. It absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving my skin feeling sticky. My skin feels instantly hydrated and soothed, and this serum is perfect for my combination to dry skin that is often irritated and suffers from redness. I love that this serum does not have a scent and that it makes my skin soft and smooth. It layers beautifully with my makeup and keeps my skin hydrated all day long. I highly recommend this serum! Very hydrating serum
