I received complimentary from Summer Friday. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to try this product. As soon as I received it, I couldn’t wait to unpack it. This is there newest eyes cream. This eye cream is a beige colored eyes cream. This are Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide and Caffeine ingredients eyes cream! It can be natural de-puffs the under eye! I usually use some eye creams that will irritate the eyes to tears! But this eye cream won’t be like that at all! Gently pat on the eye area, it is so glowing! Soft touching! Won’t irritating eyes! My eyes feel firming! Just like a wake up call for the tired eyes when use in the morning! So energizing! For brighten I believe that it will be better if I continue to use it for a long term! Recommended! Great eye cream
