The cream is quickly absorbed.  I can’t say that mimic wrinkles are gone (I squint and have to wear lenses), but the skin is moisturized and I still don’t see that the wrinkles have become deeper or new ones have appeared, but the fact that the skin seems to be stretched is felt.  Vitamin C is very good at helping the skin stay beautiful and healthy! nan
