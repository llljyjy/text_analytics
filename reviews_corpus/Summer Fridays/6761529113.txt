I was lucky enough to try this product before its release and it made a huge difference in my skin. Other retinols Iâ€™ve tried caused dryness and purging in the first few weeks but Midnight Ritual left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. My skin tone is more even and dark spots faded. SF never disappoints, another amazing product! My new skin care staple. SF never disappoints!
