I have a problem with always dry and chapped lips and use lip balms even in the summer. I love the simple packaging of this Lip Butter Balm, it is super easy to apply, plus, I’ve been using it at nights as a lip mask and love how it leaves my lips hydrated next morning. And it’s not sticky like some brands. BUT, it’s definitely not worth the price. There are a lot of other good brands for a better price nan
