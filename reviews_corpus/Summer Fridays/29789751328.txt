I love Light Aura Vitamin C + Peptide Eye Cream!) It has a very smooth texture and leaves my under eyes feeling soft and hydrated. The lines and wrinkles under my eyes are becoming much less noticeable. I have a few other skincare products by Summer Fridays and they all are amazing. And since Iâ€™ve been using products with Vitamin C and Peptides, I have been noticing much more positive results in my skin. Amazing eye cream!)
