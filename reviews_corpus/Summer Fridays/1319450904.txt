Versatile and light yet effective. I took this to a hot and humid location to wear under my tinted sunscreen (IT matte cc cream) and the products worked well together. I did not feel greasy other than the sweat, but it seemed to work as a primer. At night it is a perfect base for another lightweight or heavier cream or a buffer for treatment. I haven’t had a breakout since I started using it in my routine. I don’t know if it is indicated for acne, but my summer skin is glowing. I also have Summer Fridays light moisture in the pink jar and together with a spritz of toner for a typical evening routine. wonderful high quality. I would try more products in this line. Yes it is a dream. So versatile?
