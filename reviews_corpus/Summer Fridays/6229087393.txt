I absolutely love this new shade. It’s the perfect pop of colour and it smells like strawberry unlike the other two shades. Not sickly sweet though, it’s just perfect. My lips look like a glossy orange popsicle. I have all three shades and while this one is gorgeous, vanilla is still my ride or die. Poppy!
