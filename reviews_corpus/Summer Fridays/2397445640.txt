Best moisturizer I’ve used! I’ve been looking for a good moisturizer since moving to a dry area in California from humid Washington state. This moisturizer isn’t too heavy or greasy at all, but it moisturizes so well! After my first use of this, my skin is noticeably softer and smoother and not tight at all. I’m shocked this is so hydrating because it’s oil-free and absorbs quickly, but it is! Best Moisturizer!
