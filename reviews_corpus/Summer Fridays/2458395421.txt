I really like this serum itâ€™s very lightweight but packs in a lot of moisture. It absorbs nicely and it layered really well with my other products. What I really liked about this is after only four days of use I noticed a significant reduction in my skins redness. Gifted by Summer Fridays Great hydrating serum!
