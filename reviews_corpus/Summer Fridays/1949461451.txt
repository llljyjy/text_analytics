This is my favorite moisturizer before makeup, or for mornings in general. It’s not too heavy, but it feels like it’s actually doing something for my skin. Doesn’t alter makeup on top.  Also love the ingredient list and that there aren’t harmful ingredients. No strong smell either Fave moisturizer before makeup
