This is just amazing! Best moisturizing serum Iâ€™ve ever tried (my honest opinion). I have oily skin and moisturizers in general are difficult for me to use , since most of them clog pores and leave my skin looking greasy. This serum is a savior. Very light, yet just perfect amount of moisture to my skin.  This product makes me want to try more products from Summer Fridays! 100% recommend!This product was gifted to me by Summer Fridays. nan
