Creamy, but not heavy, with a sweet vanilla scent. Some lip balms do the opposite and dry out my lips, and this one feels velvety and creamy, but not sticky. The beige tint is slight, and it adds just bit of color and shine to my lips. Now that I’m 50, I’m finding that switching to new products is really beneficial, and is the case with this one. Will definitely buy it again! nan
