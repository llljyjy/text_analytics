Had a sample of this and loved it so I purchased it. Went to go use it for the first time and noticed tiny shiny pieces of micro metal from the tube!! So disappointed. Looked at the cap and the top of the tube and confirmed there was small pieces of metal coming off of it. Not sure if it was just that I got a bad tube or what. If you are gonna charge people this much money for a product it better not be in faulty packaging. Very disappointing bc I really do love the formula. The product itself is good. needs better packaging!!
