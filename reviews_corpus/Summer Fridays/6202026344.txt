I was so excited to receive this product from Summer Fridays! I have combo skin (leaning dry currently in the early spring), and need a skincare regimen that is super hydrating,  but isn’t thick or sit on top of the skin. This sinks right in and allows me to layer other skincare or makeup within a few minutes.  It does not have a strong scent! I also really like that it has great ingredients: HA, glycerin, and it’s rich in amino acids as well! The packaging is very sleek but durable, and really fits the natural aesthetic in my home as well. (Very superficial, but relevant to how I feel about the product!) *gifted by Summer Fridays* nan
