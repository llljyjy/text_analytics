Hm.. i have very dry skin, like peeling dry. I noticed that after using this my face was less flaky but it did not give me that quenched skin feeling i was looking for. This did improve the overall quality of my face but did not improve the dry skin. Compared to a facial oil this product seems a tad obsolete in my routine. okay serum
