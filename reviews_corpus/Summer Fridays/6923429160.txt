Iâ€™ve been loving the Dream Hydration Serum that I was gifted by Summer Fridays. It has a jelly texture, I think this would make a great lightweight moisturizer for oily skin. I have very dry skin so have been applying this before my moisturizer or mixing the two together and the combo leaves my skin feeling hydrated! Great mixed into my moisturizer
