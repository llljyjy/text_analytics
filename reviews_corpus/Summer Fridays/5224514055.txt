NON SPONSORED REVIEWY’all, I have the most insane skin of all time. It’s sensitive to everything. I have skin conditions that make taking care of my skin nearly impossible it feels. I’ve spent thousands trying to find what can help me. Most oils are awful, but I have to say, I can’t live without this. When my skin is angry and burning this instantly soothes it. It WILL sink into your skin. I was using Sunday Riley Juno before this and I will not go back. I have combo and reactive skin. It also becomes super dry. I do not waste my time on reviews but if you’re struggling with skin just give it a try. I both mix it in my moisturizer and layer it on top at night. It soothes and softens and makes it appear brighter and healthier. No breakouts!!! My derm and esthetician encourage usage since it helps. I will never be without. It’s worth trying I promise you! LISTEN UP!!!
