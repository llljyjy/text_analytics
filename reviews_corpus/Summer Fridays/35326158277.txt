While I had high expectations for this brand and product, I felt slightly let down. This product may look nice and glossy at first - but doesn’t last long enough in my opinion. The balm needs to be reapplied generously often. Which may come as an issue since it’s only 15g of product and $30. In addition, it’s obvious that the tube has air in it, which was disappointing. Why isn’t it filled with product? The scent is nice. Formula is more sticky than it is hydrating. I’d skip this purchase. nan
