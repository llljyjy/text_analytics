I have only been using this product for a few weeks and the results have been amazing. It smells very beautiful and it leaves a  glow under my eyes. I struggle with dark under eyes, and I have noticed that they have been lightened and more illuminated ever since I started using this eye cream. The consistency is perfect and the amount of hydration it gives me is exactly what i’m looking for (and I still can’t get over the cute packaging!! I’m obsessed!!!) Also, you only need to use a tiny amount so this is definitely going to last me a while! This eye cream has truly helped me channel my inner aura through self care. A hydrating glow
