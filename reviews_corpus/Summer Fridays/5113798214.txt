I’ve been using this product since it was released in 2018. To say I’m obsessed is an understatement. I literally use this mask every single day of my life - either as a thick moisturizer on its own (a life saver on those busy days), or as a hydrating mask to prep my skin before I apply my skincare. I’ve never had a problem with this mask irritating my skin. My skin is always hydrated and glowy post use which for me is a must since I suffer from dry skin mostly (I get oily in my T-zone but it’s still amazing all over) I absolutely can not live without this mask, it is a staple in my skincare always. Gentle enough for everyone - I have very sensitive skin and break out crazy easily. It even works for my mother and friend who suffer from rosacea! I honestly cannot recommend this mask enough! shout it from the rooftops - this is AMAZING!
