I love Summer Fridays and was so excited to try this moisturizer! However, this just isn’t working well for me as a winter moisturizer. My skin is looking/feeling dry mid-day and at the end of the day looks sooo dry. I haven’t had my skin like this in months and so it’s a little disappointing. I would use a heavier moisturizer for cooler months but feel this would be great in the summer months! nan
