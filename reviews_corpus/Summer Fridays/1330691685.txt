To this rich yet lightweight hydration serum. That works well with my oily skin type. I have added this serum to my morning and nighttime routines - a minimum of a half pump to a full pump, really locking and holding in the moisture for super soft skin without feeling greasy. It layers well and compliments all my other skincare and makeup products. And is completely fragrance-free. Kinda addicted.
