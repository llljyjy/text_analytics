I’ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks and it’s my new go-to. I have a hard time finding an eye cream that isn’t either sticky or too light weight.  This is the perfect in between! My under eye area is hydrated and looks refreshed. I like that the cream is moisturizing but doesn’t leave any residue behind and makes me look bright-eyed with every use. New Fave!
