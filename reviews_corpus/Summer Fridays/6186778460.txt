Wow wow wow. Let me preface by saying my rosacea this year has been like no other. Dry, red, itchy patches on both my cheeks. I use a gentle cleanser, avoiding active products, and basically tried all barrier creams that have been released this year. No luck, until I was sent this. I used this consistently day and night, and immediately even the next morning I noticed soothed skin and less redness. My patches now are less visible. The dryness, itchiness, and flaking are completely gone. If you are struggling with Rosacea you have to try this! I am beyond grateful for this serum, and purchasing a backup because I cannot be without. Donâ€™t forget to use your SPF DAILY. fellow sufferers of rosacea
