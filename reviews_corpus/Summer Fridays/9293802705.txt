Wow, just wow. I recently spent 2 weeks it Italy and I brought with me a sample size of Jet Lag to use as an overnight mask. I was blown away! I woke up to the smoothest plump skin. A little goes a long way too. I just bought the full size. It’s a very moisturizing formula that also plumps up my fine lines. I’m in love with this stuff and I even use it around my eyes. Excellent performance!
