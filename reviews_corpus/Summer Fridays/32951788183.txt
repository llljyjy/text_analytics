Complimentary from Summer Fridays. This has a vanilla scent that isn’t too intense yet isn’t very faint. The shade I received provides a nice glow (no tint) to my lips. My lips feel moisturized when I’m wearing this and I only find myself reapplying after I’ve eaten. Overall, I like it, but it does feel a little bit like glorified Vaseline. The price is a bit up there for a lip balm, but I do imagine it’ll last me a while since it does have 15 grams of product. nan
