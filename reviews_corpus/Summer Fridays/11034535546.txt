Honestly just an overhyped product, pretty light scent not very moisturizing doesn’t last and you need to reapply. I Feel the need to finish it because its pricey, haven’t used it a ton and it’s already almost gone. Doesn’t have much product. If you want something actually worrth it I would buy Glossier balm dotcom instead. Influenced by the internet
