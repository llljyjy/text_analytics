I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays. My lips tend to get very dry, especially in the winter so I need a thick, moisturizing lip balm. This is a great lip balm all around. From the packaging, to the scent, and down to how it performs. The applicator makes it easy to use and squeeze out the right amount without making a mess. As for the formula, it’s super buttery and glides right across the lips. Smells like classic vanilla which I can’t complain about. It works like a charm! Keeps my lips hydrated and soft for hours. I find I rarely have to reapply throughout the day compared to other lip balms I’ve tried. It’s just that good! Love everything about it
