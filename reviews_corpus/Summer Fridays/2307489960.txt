I really like this moisturizer but it’s not good as a year round moisturizer. Typically I would use this before putting my make up on in the summer/fall time. But in the winter time I do not recommend this, if your skin needs a rich moisturizer this is not the one for you. I tried to use this in the winter time and it would burn my skin from how dry my skin was. If you’re looking for something really light weight then buy this. nan
