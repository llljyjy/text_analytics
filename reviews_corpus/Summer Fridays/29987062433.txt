I received this item complimentary from Summer Fridays.  First & foremost, this smells soooooo good! I expected this to be goopy & sticky. I didn’t think I’d like it at all. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I LOVE this!!! A little goes such a long way. It’s so silky, smooth & stays on for hours. I’m wearing it as a daily gloss. I can’t get enough of it. Totally buying another tube when this one runs out...which will be soon with how often I wear it. Best balm yet!
