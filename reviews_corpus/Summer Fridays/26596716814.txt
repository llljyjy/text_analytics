I read so many good reviews of this product online but it definitely did not live up to the hype. When I received it, no pigment came out of the tube when I applied it, it was just a clear balm. I tried massaging the tube and shaking it, but I barely got any pigment to come out. I gave it three stars for the gorgeous glossy finish and nice sophisticated vanilla scent, but other lip products can deliver those things with better results. Hopefully I just got a dud product, but disappointing nonetheless. No Pigment- just clear balm
