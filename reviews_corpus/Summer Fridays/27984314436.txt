I received this product complimentary from Summer Fridays.This lip balm smells nice and sweet. The shade looks natural and slightly shiny, I can feel my lips are smoother and softer after using it. Also, the texture is very creamy but not sticky. It’s really great for winter time. I like the packaging, it looks clean and minimal but I think it’s a bit too long to put in my pocket. It’s almost doubled the size of my regular lip balms. nan
