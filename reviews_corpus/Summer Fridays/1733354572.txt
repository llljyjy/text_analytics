I like this eye cream but noticed if I put on too much I do break out a little (like 1-2 pimples at the tops of my cheeks). I have combo skin and for me it wears well under makeup, and hydrates nicely especially in the colder months. In the summer, I just use this at night because itâ€™s pretty humid where I live so I opt for use a light serum under my eyes which is better for me. Solid Eyecream!
