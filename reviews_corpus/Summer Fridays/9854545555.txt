This is my favorite lip balm — I’m on my second tube of the Vanilla scent. It’s literally like butter for your lips. It glides on so smooth and keeps my lips hydrated all day. I have the Vanilla one and I’m obsessed with the scent. It’s natural and light and lingers for a little after applying, without being over powering. I highly recommend the Lip Butter Balm to anyone — I’ve already gotten a few of my friends to try it and they’ve fallen in love with it too! I just ordered their new Poppy scent and I can’t wait to try Brown Sugar! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
