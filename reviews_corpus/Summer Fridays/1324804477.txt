Absolutely love this stuff! I used it as a last step in my nighttime routine. It’s super lightweight and really made my skin feel plump, hydrated and refreshed. The texture isn’t sticky or thick. It reminds me of Belief’s Aqua Bomb, but this has a muchhhh better ingredients list. Aqua Bomb has denatured alcohol and unnecessary added fragrances - Cloud Dew is clean and free of those crappy ingredients. Recommend giving it a try! Lightweight and Hydrating
