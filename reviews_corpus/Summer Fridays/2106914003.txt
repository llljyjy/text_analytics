This is a lovely serum for anyone who is looking for gentle yet effective hydration. Ever since being prescribed a retinoid, I have been battling dry, flaky skin (when I usually am very oily). This is one of the very few products that has worked to restore moisture and help repair my skin barrier (the only other product that has worked is Cerave, but it is a bit heavy for the face!). This product feels lightweight and has extremely minimal fragrance. It has not caused any breakouts on my acne prone skin. I highly recommend this for anyone looking to add moisture to their skincare routine. nan
