I love this brown lippie! It’s a solid color, no shimmer. Second shade i’ve purchased and i just want more! It’s not my favorite balm (petroleum based are better) for dryness, but it does keep my lips chapped free for the daytime. I get compliments when i wear these as if i’m wearing lipstick. It doesn’t feel goopy and looks really natural and subtle. nan
