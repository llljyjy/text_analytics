I’ve been looking forward to SF creating an eye cream. This did not disappoint. It is not thick or greasy just the perfect consistency. It’s got some glow which provides that bright hydrated look. I prefer to use this in the mornings and even then I definitely notice a difference in my under eyes. nan
