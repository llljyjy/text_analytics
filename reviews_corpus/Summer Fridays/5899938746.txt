The product is fantastic. We recently moved and I lost my bottle somewhere in all the boxes, and my skin can absolutely tell. It’s a 5-star product, but I miss the old packaging terribly. It was SO nice and clean, and being able to put two pumps in my hand each time helped so much in not seeing any of this pricey product go to waste. Maybe it’s a supply chain issue with getting the glass bottles and pumps, but please switch back to the old packaging when you can! 5-star product but miss the old packaging
