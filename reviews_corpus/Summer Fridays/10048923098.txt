This is one of my favorite brands for lip balms, the vanilla & the brown sugar(limited edition :( ) are amazing so seeing this got me excited. The citrus scent made me hesitant though, because it only says it’s citrus scented but that can smell like many things & people reviewing it really only say “it smells good” so that doesnt help me lol. Bit the bullet and got it, the formula like always is great, makes my lips soft, hydrated & gives them a nice glossy look. Now onto the citrus scent, it’s sweet, kinda reminds me of the orange gummy candies covered with sugar but at the same time I also get an orange creamsicle (the one with orange on the outside & white on the inside). Amazing
