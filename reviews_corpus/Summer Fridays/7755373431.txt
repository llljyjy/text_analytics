I’ve tried more than a dozen eye creams, so I was pleasantly surprised to see Summer Fridays make a game-changing addition to the category.  Never before have I seen an eye cream with natural light reflectors that give the cream a shimmery quality.  I was initially concerned that it may look artificial on the skin and make it seem like I’ve spread glitter under my eyes, but that’s not the case at all.  It gives the under eye area a very natural dewy illumination.  Even though the eye cream has a thick, buttery texture and is very hydrating, it still absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy.  It has a subtly sweet scent and a peach color that gives a slight tint to the under eye area, which is perfect for color correcting dark circles and looks natural even on my fair skin.  It also works great under make-up, preventing concealer from settling into my lines and not causing any pilling. Natural, dewy illumination!
