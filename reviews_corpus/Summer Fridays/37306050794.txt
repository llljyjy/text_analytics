Everyone seems to be raving about this product and I was so excited when I purchased it. However, once I opened the product I was utterly disappointed to find that there was barely anything in the tube, as the product itself was half empty. After that, I proceeded to call the Sephora where I purchased the product. I was disappointed at what they told me they could do when I told them that the product was half empty. As a long-time Sephora customer, I was surprised. I really wanted to love the product but the experience completely disappointed me as a customer. Half empty and fully disappointed
