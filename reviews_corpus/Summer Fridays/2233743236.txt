I have suppppper dryyyy lips this season, and with all the holiday parties its embarrassing lol I just tried out the Summer Fridays Lip Balm in Vanilla and I love it! It is super hydrating like a regular balm, but with a nice glossy shine to it. And it stayed in place, which I loved. The smell was nice too, I’m usually very picky about that but the vanilla was a nice muted scent, not overpowering. It is a thick formula, so it did transfer somewhat onto my drinks, but that’s to be expected of a lip balm. Highly recommend specially for those mornings when you are on the go but want to look put together. Must have for dry lips
