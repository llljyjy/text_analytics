Not a lot of product in the tube. I bought this for my purse to refresh my lips throughout the day and it is almost empty and I’ve had it for a couple weeks! A basic chapstick or literally any other balm will last me months. For this reason I won’t be rebuying. But the product itself I really like. It is hydrating and I like the new and improved design. Just don’t like how little product you get. Too little product
