Here is all I got to say about this product. It’s nice but it’s not worth the price. I love that the applicator is concave but that’s all about it that stands out from it’s competition. It has a nice subtle vanilla scent that I would describe as marsh mellow scent apposed to vanilla. I do really enjoy that scent, which is unmatched. If you are not a vanilla fan, this is good for you because it has a lighter marsh mellowier smell. Would I but it again? Meh, it’s nice but it’s not worth the price. There are many better lip products for hydration, rejuvenation, tint and shine. for instance Dior lip products, Lanolin, Aquaphor, and Kiehl’s #1 lip balm are all superior lip products for chap lips. Did I enjoy this product? Yes. Would I buy it again? No. But then again I only tried the Vanilla Beige lip butter, which is tinted. Good not Great
