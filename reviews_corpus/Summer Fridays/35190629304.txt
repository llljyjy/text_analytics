This mask really helped with my dry skin. I use it as an overnight mask I donâ€™t wipe it off as instructed because my skin literally drinks the product in seconds, after I wake up my face feels so soft and glowing. I feel like it resets my skin every time I use it so I really love it. Must for dry skin
