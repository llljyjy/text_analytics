My favorite SF product by far, I have combo/sensitive skin and I get redness often. I use The Outsetâ€™s cleaner & eye cream and their vegan collagen serum then I use this last before spf and my skin has never been calmer and clearer. The ingredients are great, it absorbs well and has no fragrance! Ugh, I love this serum/cream! Perfect lightweight moisturizer
