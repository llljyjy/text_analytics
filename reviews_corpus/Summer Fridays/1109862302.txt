I love Summer Fridays products and was looking forward to try this serum and it did not disappoint. Itâ€™s hydrating, lightweight, gel-like and absorbs very fast - perfect for warmer months. I have normal/sensitive skin and applied a moisturizer on top of it, but if you have oily skin you might be fine just with this serum + SPF. Perfect for the summer!
