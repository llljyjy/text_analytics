This is a great cleanser. I have dry sensitive skin and this is the only cleanser that gets my skin actually clean but also not stripped at all. I had been using milky and oily cleansers because those were very gentle for me but they left a film on my face and I never felt really clean. The Summer Friday’s cleanser smells really nice and it only takes a little bit to get a good gentle lather going. It doesn’t foam up much at all but it gets off all of my mineral sunscreen. I don’t wear makeup so I can’t speak to that. It says don’t use around your eyes but I do anyways and I’ve never experienced any stinging or irritation. nan
