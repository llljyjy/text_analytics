My experience with eye creams hasn’t been great so I was hesitant to try Summer Fridays despite the reviews. I have dark circles and my concealer on its own would accentuate the circles and creases so I was looking for a hydrating cream that could be layered under makeup and help brighten up my tired under-eyes. The ones I’ve tried in the past have been great to apply on bare skin but ruined any makeup I applied over top. This product is exceptional! The texture is creamy and applies beautifully on skin and underneath concealer. I’m absolutely in love! nan
