Honestly I was pretty skeptical about this product, more so because I have sensitive skin so nothing usually works for me or my skin flares up. But this was such a good eye cream! It helped with the puffiness around my eyes in the morning. The only thing is that my under eyes did start to sting after I first applied it but that usually happens. To be fair, I don’t think it’s any better than any other drugstore brand and I don’t think it’s really worth the $40. Decent
