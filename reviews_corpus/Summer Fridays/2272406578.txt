This eye cream from Summer Fridays is very smooth, fast absorb and not oily when apply to my skin. I also donâ€™t have the irritating feeling on the skin, unlike many other eye creams I have tried. I have seen the dark circles have brightened a little bit toward the end of my eyes after a week of use. Hopefully will see more positive result after a month. Smooth and well absorbent
