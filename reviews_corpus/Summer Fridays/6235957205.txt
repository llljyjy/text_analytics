this serum makes my skin so smooth, bright, and hydrated. I look so fresh when I use it. However, there is a product in my morning skincare routine that it pills under. It is either my tatcha vitamin c serum, the tatcha essence, or black girl sunscreen 30spf. Be wary if you hate pilling and use those products. I find that I can avoid the pilling when I dont rub or touch my face too often. I also use it in my nighttime routine and experience no pilling (using tatcha silk cream, and le prunier oil). I think itâ€™s a must try! Incredible, must-try product! (pills occasionally)
