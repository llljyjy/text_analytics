I love a good eye mask. I am a big retinol fan for my face and have never seen another retinol eye mask. The sheet itself is soft and comes with a healthy amount of serum on them. The serum soaks into your skin more than most eye masks Iâ€™ve tried. I can see the difference after using in fine lines, brightness, and tightness around eyes. They are my new go-to eye masks. Highly recommended. nan
