This product is amazing! I’ve been a fan of Murad for some years now so I was really excited to try this. It helped protect my skin from the sun and it wasn’t too greasy. I love that it actually feels like a serum. You do have to shake it well though. I also like that it does not go on white on darker skin tones. That’s been my experience with anything that’s mineral protection. It blends in well with my complexion. Serum and Sun Protection
