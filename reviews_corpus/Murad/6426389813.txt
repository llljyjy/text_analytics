I’ve only tried this product once and even though I don’t notice a huge difference, my under eye area feels hydrated and tighter. (Not in a painful way) I will have to continue using this before I can be sure if this is a product I will keep in my skin care routine. I guess 15 minutes wasn’t long enough
