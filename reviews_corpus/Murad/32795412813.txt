I was gifted Retinol Youth Renewal Serum, and itâ€™s my new favorite addition to my night routine. I love how gentle it is! I normally have to start very slow with retinol. I started using this every night and have had no irritation. Also, my wrinkles on my forehead have buffed, and my skin is left looking plump and glowing. You definitely need to add this to your night routine too! Nightly routine must have!
