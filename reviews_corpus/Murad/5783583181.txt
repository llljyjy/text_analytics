I received this product complimentary from Murad Skincare. I must say I am quite impressed with this product. It has indeed the consistency of a serum, very lightweight, but the potency of a mineral sunscreen. Nice sturdy bottle that comes with a pipette dropper. No particular smell. It absorbs into the skin right away and it does not leave a white cast at all. I have sensitive combination skin and it worked really well with my established morning skincare routine. Also it goes well under my makeup, does not cause pilling and it is not sticky. A bit pricey, but itâ€™s definitely worth the money. What can I say, I am impressed
