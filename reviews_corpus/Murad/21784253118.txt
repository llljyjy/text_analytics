I’ll admit that the price is intimidating, but if I had to splurge on one skincare product every once in a while, this would be it. I use it twice to three times each week in the morning prior to applying serum and sunscreen, and I love the slight glow and smooth feeling it gives to my skin. If you use the product according to the instructions, I truly feel like you can maximize the product’s benefits while not having to repurchase frequently so a little definitely goes a long way.
