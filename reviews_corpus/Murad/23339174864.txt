I only tried this product once so I’m not sure if I got all the benefits out of the under eye masks as opposed to someone who uses it more consistently. However I really liked this product however I noticed that one patch was significantly thinner than the other one. Other than that it’s all very refreshing.I also noticed they cover a very large portion of the face Try again
