My 20-something daughter & I both love this gel moisturizer. It’s great for helping to restore the skin barrier without being heavy or greasy. Goes great under makeup, yet is moisturizing enough to wear at night. It smells divine and doesn’t give me headaches. 4 stars because it’s expensive, so I buy it during the beauty events. Once in a while it goes on sale @ 50% off. Yes, definitely!
