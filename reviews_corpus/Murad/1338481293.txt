This is such an interesting product! I haven’t been using it long enough to see results in lines yet, but there are some immediate blurring effects because of the formula. It fills in fine lines, and is a good base for concealer. At night, it works well with other skincare, settles in without pilling or doing anything weird. I love the applicator - it is so cooling and nice to use if you don’t want to use your fingers. Excited to keep using this to see if I’ll see long term results. Nice product but needs longer to work
