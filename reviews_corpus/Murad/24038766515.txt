This product was gifted by Murad. It’s a 2% salicylic acid treatment for acne prone skin. I have chin acne papules for a long time and is happy to try this product. Unfortunately after several daily applications it didn’t work out for me maybe it’s too mild for my problem. But it’s very gentle on skin and calming. nan
