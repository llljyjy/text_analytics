I’ve been testing out this Murad Rapid Dark Spot Correcting Serum for a week now and I can definitely tell it made my face brighter and even-looking. I use this twice a day, morning, and night after cleansing.  It feels very comfortable on the skin, doesn’t dry it out or anything like that. I can see a real difference in the dark spots I get due to breakouts. I was gifted by Murad Skincare but my opinions are my own Great for dark spot
