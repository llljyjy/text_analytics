Decent! The ingredients & benefits are excellent; plus, it felt so nice on the face & even stayed in place without sliding around at all, which has never happened before. My under eye area looked & felt amazing for days! BUT, it was a struggle to separate the sheets from each other & their protective layer. I wasnâ€™t even sure which side was suppose to go against my skin. The instructions were not helpful for that so Idk if I applied them correctly or not, but I doubt it matters too much. At least I still saw results! Too expensive per treatment though, especially if used anywhere as often as they recommend. Almost perfect!
