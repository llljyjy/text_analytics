While at my store one of the sales consultant who is also a cosmetologist recommended this product to me. I was looking for a toner (Clarins is no longer sold in the store). I decided to purchase it but was somewhat hesitant in doing so. Well, blow me away!  Best product ever. It is an excellent toner as well as clarifying. It is now my forever favorite skin care product. Love! Love! Love this product!
