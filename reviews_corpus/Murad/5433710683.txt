This is my all-time favorite SPF. The consistency is very light but creamy and moisturizing, and the scent is very subtle and citrusy and my favorite thing about it. It took a little trial and error but I discovered that if I wait a few minutes for my skincare to set before applying this, then wait another few minutes to let it dry down, it doesnâ€™t pill under my makeup. I have sensitive skin and have never had a reaction to this product. nan
