So about 3 days ago I woke up to the worst breakout I have ever had in my life. I barely had acne growing up and even as a young adult my skin was always clear. Over the last few months I have been dealing with hormonal acne, I eat pretty well, I drink tons of water, no sodas or sugary drinks besides my one cup of coffee every morning. I also take supplements for skin and to my friends I am considered a skin care snob when it comes to my products! However ever since these hormonal issues came into play I just can’t seem to get my skin under control I was so embarrassed I called out of work it was that bad! I have always used Murads salicylic acne face wash almost ten years now it’s been a staple in my routine but that wasn’t even cutting it. I decided to purchase this product same day delivery from Sephora because I was not leaving my house, I wish I could post pictures in this thread but as soon as I get done here I will post my review with pictures on Sephoras app. It’s day 3 and my skin looks a million and one times better then when I started. I was terrified this product would burn but it was so soothing and it didn’t dry out my already inflamed skin. This product will be something I always keep on hand from this day forward because I can’t even begin to explain how amazing this product is for acne sufferer’s thank you Murad for making such an incredible product!!! Skin care savior!!!
