I used this treatment a few times and didn’t notice a difference in my skin. I have dry sensitive skin but don’t have too much acne. I let my husband use it and noticed it helped a lot more with his redness. He has combo skin and is much redder than I am.  I’m sure he’ll finish it up and I do love Murad but it’s a bit expensive for what it does. Gifted by Murad Skincare Works well for redness
