I’ve been in the market for a new sunscreen for my face (especially after seeing that photo of the woman who didn’t put sunscreen on her neck!!). I decided to try this one as I love Murad products. It is a more liquid form so I have been mixing it with my face moisturizer. The only thing I don’t love about the product is that it does feel like it pills on your skin if you don’t wait for your other products to soak in really well. When I mix it with my moisturizer, it works much better. nan
