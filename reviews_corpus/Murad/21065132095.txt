I bought this one of the recent VIB Sales and I didnâ€™t use it until a few months after I bought and I really wish I had started using it right away. I had acne as a teen (in my 30s now) and have occasional acne spots so I have some scars on my cheeks and I have noticed lightening of the scars within just a week of use. The texture on my cheeks is also a lot smoother as well. I will continue to repurchase this. I use it once a day to get these results. I wish I tried this sooner!
