I have dry and sensitive skin. I have tried other Murad products before and they have never disappointed. This retinol however, BLEW MY MIND! It is a little too early to tell if I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles, however, I can definitely see a difference in my skin texture. My skin is much smoother and glowy. I definitely see why they named it Youthful, because it does give the skin a nice radiance the next morning. I did give it 4 stars simply because I haven’t used it enough to notice drastic changes like they claim. I’m still new to the product. But I can see some differences already.
