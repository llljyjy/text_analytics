I received this complimentary from Murad for my honest review. I like the dropper packaging of this. You are able to get the perfect amount. It goes onto the skin well. It does leave a bit of a greasy dewy like look. I would prefer a more matte finish and not a typical sunscreen look.  Otherwise it was good. Good but greasy
