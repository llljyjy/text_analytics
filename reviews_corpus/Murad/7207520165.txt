I’m on my second bottle now. Since I stopped taking birth control, I have been getting chest and back acne. I get the big cysts too. I believe it’s hormonal acne, since I get them about once a month, and I only get acne around my chin, not my whole face.I like using this as a preventative measure. I notice I don’t get bad flare ups when I use this every day. It’s expensive, but it does last me over 6 months for a bottle. I try to not use too much at a time. Works on hormonal acne
