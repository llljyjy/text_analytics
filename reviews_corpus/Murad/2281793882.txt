This product was gifted by Murad Skincare for review purposes. I’m not sure how I feel about this product. It seemed to have flattened a couple of my smaller breakouts, but I can’t say the same for my cystic acne spots. I’m trying to incorporate it into my skincare routine, but it’s not as versatile as I want it to be. nan
