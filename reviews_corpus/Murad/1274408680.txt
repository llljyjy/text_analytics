I was gifted this product in exchange for my honest review and I feel like I need to thank them for helping me find a magical spf. All of us who regularly reappear their sunscreen throughout the day know that finding great products that reapply easily over makeup are a huge challenge. This serum changes the game. It’s so light weight and easy to dab with your fingertips to reapply. It literally melts into your skin. It’s magical. So thankful to add this to my everyday routine to help protect my skin! Must Have Sunscreen!!!
