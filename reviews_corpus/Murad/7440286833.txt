I really wanted to love these but that didn’t happen. First, these patches are way too big, which I liked at first because I thought it would help the area around my eyes too. But the patches just kept slipping down to my cheek. They just have no grip and it’s not ideal to keep repositioning them. I also didn’t really notice a huge change after using them. my undereye area did look more moisturized but any serum will do that so I’m not very impressed. nan
