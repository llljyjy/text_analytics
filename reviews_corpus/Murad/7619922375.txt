Works great! Definitely give it a few weeks before making a judgement. I get random flare-ups or hormonal acne that attacks my entire jawline/cheeks and leaves awful scarring. Within 3 weeks, over half of the scars are gone, and all of them are faded. It feels greasy, and I was worried that it was going to make me break out more, but it absorbs into the skins pretty well.I wash my face with Kate Somerville Goat Milk Moisturizing Cleanser, then I use a generous amount of Origins Super Spot Remover™ Acne Treatment Gel (which has worked wonders the past 3 weeks to clear up my break up as well!), then I apply Murad InvisiScar Post-Acne Resurfacing Treatment, and then I finish with Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Hyaluronic Marine Oil-Free Moisture Cushion and Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Boost 360° Brightening Eye Cream.Its incredible how much better my face looks after starting this new routine! Cleared by hormonal acne scars in 3 weeks!
