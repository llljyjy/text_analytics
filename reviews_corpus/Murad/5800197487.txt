I’m a big fan of Murad products and I really love this dark spot corrector serum. I have acne blemishes and unfortunately I pick at them so it leaves marks on my cheeks once they heal. This has definitely helped and my skin is looking much better in the areas where I have dark spots they’re noticeably lighter.  Gifted by Murad skincare but all opinions are my own. Dark spot eraser
