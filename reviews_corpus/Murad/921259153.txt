This isn’t the usual bio-cellulose eye mask that I’m familiar with. This is absolutely the best!! I loved the bigger size, the thicker material, and how easy it was to apply. It did not slide down at all and stayed in place for the whole 15 minutes. I could feel a slight tingling sensation. After taking them off, I could see my under-eye area look smoother and firmer. There was less puffiness, felt refreshed, and did not cause any irritation. I even enjoyed the extra serum in the packet. I was very impressed with just the first use and will be keeping this in my skincare routine. They are pricey, but I think they are worth it with the results I saw. Great results!!
