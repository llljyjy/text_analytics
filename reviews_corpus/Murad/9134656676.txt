To start, I’m in my 20s without a lot of deep wrinkles. However, I have 2 deep lines across my forehead that have always bothered me. I have been consistently applying this treatment to them, and I am shocked at the improvement. My forehead is so much smoother and the lines are considerably fainter. I’m very impressed and will continue to use this on my existent lines and any that may dare to appear. nan
