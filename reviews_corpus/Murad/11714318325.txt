This product works, and it works quickly. In less than a month, with irregular use, my dark marks were gone (and sun damage that I’ve never been able to fade). I also have sensitive skin and haven’t experienced any breakouts. The only thing preventing me from repurchasing is the cost. Now that my dark marks are gone, I don’t see this product as being so beneficial. I don’t use it regularly, and I think if I bought a bottle, it would sit on my counter for a very long time. I used it maybe.. 2-3 times a week.So yeah. It works, and if you have a lot of dark marks and sun damage, this could be a wonderful addition to your route. Yeah, it works..
