I really love this for the sides of my cheeks because that’s where I have the most hyperpigmentation. I use this serum daily and it doesn’t cause irritation to my skin which makes me love it even more. I can’t wait to see how my skin looks in a few more weeks, so far I see my lighter hyperpigmentation fading slowly. I’ve tried different products from murad and know already they most definitely work, so I’m excited! Complimentary from Murad Skincare Murad products are sooo good
