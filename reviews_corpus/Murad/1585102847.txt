Always receive compliments about my “glowing and bright” skin when I use this product (compared to Caudalie’s radiance serum that I rotate with). A little bit goes a long way and I do use it at night only to let the stuff work its magic while I sleep. I protect my skin with sunblock during the day since this will make you sensitive to ultraviolet rays. It does not really get rid of dark spots from aging but it does provide a healthier shine for your skin. I enjoy using it when I want a break from retinol and my bleaching cream. I have normal-dry skin and minimal breakouts and my skin can tolerate mild burning before adjusting from initial use. This can be too strong for people with super sensitive skin. Provides that Glow!
