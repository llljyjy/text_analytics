I have sensitive eyes so I usually avoid eye masks but Iâ€™m glad I tried these retinol eye masks!! They are on the pricier side but they work incredibly!! I use it 2x a week during my nighttime routine and it makes my under eye area look hydrated, refreshed, wrinkles softened, and way less puffy!! I like to leave it on for 15mins and my under eye area just loves it!! A holy grail product for me! A MUST BUY for under eye area!!
