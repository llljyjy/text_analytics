Absolutely love this! So rare to find a matte chemical sunscreen, especially one with PA++++ UVA protection. Dries down very nicely and helps keep my oily skin matte all day, even under makeup. I also like the hint of citrus in the scent, no typical sunscreen smell. This also does not sting my eyes. Spreads quickly and smoothly all over the face. Very enjoyable product, this would be my go-to SPF if it were a little more budget friendly. new fave
