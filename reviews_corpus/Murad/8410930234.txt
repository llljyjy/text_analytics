I really wanted to like this, but it made me break out. I have normal to dry skin, and I’m 52, so this isn’t something that happens often.I wasn’t sure if this was causing the break outs, so I cut everything else out of my routine except the moisturizer and sunscreen that I’ve been using forever, and every time I got a zit. Twice on my chin (still trying to get that to fade), and once on my cheek, which hasn’t happened since I was a teenager. Caused break outs
