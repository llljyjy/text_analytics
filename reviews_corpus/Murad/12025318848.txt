Gifted by Murad. These are absolutely hands down the best designed eye patches I’ve tried. They’re longer than normal which I angle to get the sides of my eye, like a winged liner. They also stay out! No moving around, they actually stay where you put them. They’re thin enough to not feel but also thick enough I don’t break them with my nails trying to put them on. They’re very hydrating, cooling and leave my eyes feeling awake and ready for the day. Perfect shape that stays in place
