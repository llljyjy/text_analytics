Gifted by Murad. I really wanted to love this product since it’s glycolic acid with vitamin c, however I wasn’t really impressed. I could smell too much of the fragrance and it smelt lovely but I don’t want that on my face. I wish brands would stop using fragrance in skincare because most people just can’t tolerate it So and so
