Absolutely love Murad spf 45. The best part of it is how gentle it is to apply to my textured skin. I will say it slightly oily for those who donâ€™t like to be extra hydrated such as people with combination to oily skin. It does not leave a white cast either! Which is a plus. Great boost of radiance
