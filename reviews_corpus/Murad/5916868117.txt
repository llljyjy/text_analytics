These eye masks were very easy to apply and felt very comfortable under my eyes. I was not able to see immediate results as I only tried out the product once, but I would be willing to try these out again. What caught my interest was the claims to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and the ingredients. I applied them right before bed time and left them on for 15 minutes. It was definitely cooling and hydrating for my under eyes. Definitely hydrating!
