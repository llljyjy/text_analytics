This product was gifted to me by Murad. I suffer from hormonal acne so I’m always down to try a new spot treatment. This is gentle enough but unfortunately I didn’t see great results in helping with cystic acne. I don’t think it hurt anything but I didn’t see great results with it. Nice but not super powerful
