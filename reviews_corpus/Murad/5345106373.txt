I’ve only used this one time, but I will share my experience with you here. If you’re going to have lasting results from retinol, I think you’d need to use this weekly at least. Overall, once I figured out how to remove the outer layers from the eye masks, I applied them and they felt very cooling and soothing on my under eye area. They fit pretty well. And, I kept it on for 30 minutes. My under eye area looked depuffed and smoother. I just wish I could get a few sets in a pack. Depuffed and Smooth Thank you
