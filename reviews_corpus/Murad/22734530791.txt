I received this product complimentary from Murad. I was super excited to try this SPF, the texture is runny and so easy to work with, it blends in beautifully but unfortunately itâ€™s really greasy and stays that way. If you apply it on dry skin without any skincare it absorbs better but with anything else it just sits on the skin and makes it look so oily. nan
