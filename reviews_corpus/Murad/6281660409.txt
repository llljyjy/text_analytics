I like this product, but it doesnâ€™t work instantly. I suffer from hormonal acne and I was hoping this would work to eradicate any bumps overnight. This product does help with reducing the overall redness and size of any blemishes, but I found you have to use it each night for 2-3 days before it makes any real difference. I also do not care for the packaging - I think it could have easily been put into a squeezy tube that would be much easier to use. Gifted by Murad Skincare. nan
