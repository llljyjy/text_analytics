Gifted by Murad. The renewal eye mask had raised dots which I believe helped in the mask staying put. It literally did not move which means I could use the 15 minutes to do other stuff! It was so gentle and hydrating. The mask itself is huge — very generous in terms of area! It’s cool to the touch and my under eye area feels tighter now. This eye mask was such a treat. nan
