This is my first Murad product I ever used ) I love the super light consistency of this mineral sunscreen against UVA/UVB/Blue light & pollution. It absorbs quick without leaving oily feeling or white cast. I love that it is not only sunscreen, it also corrects the dark spots from sun damage (which is my all time problem) Love the consistency
