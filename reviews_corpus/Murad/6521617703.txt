Product was gifted by Murad Skincare in exchange for an honest review. I’ve been using it for about a week now and am really enjoying it. I’m currently having a lot of breakouts so it showed up just in time. It’s invisible when applied to the skin which is nice. And hels to clear up my breakouts. Reduces redness almost immediately. And the bump of the breakout fades within a few hours. nan
