I suffer from really bad hormonal and cystic acne - I’ve tried every trick in the book. Am currently on medication for it which helps but every once in a while a stubborn, deep cystic pimple still pops up and this is the ONLY thing I’ve ever used that has actually made a difference fairly quickly. I had an awful/huge/deep breakout on my cheek a few weeks ago and happened to have just received this complimentary from Murad Skincare, so I used it as spot treatment for a few nights and it significantly brought down the size, pressure and pain of it. You can really tell it’s an incredible formula! nan
