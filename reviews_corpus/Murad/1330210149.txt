This sunscreen is SILKY! I’ve never had this serum/spf combo which is what makes it SUCH a game changer in beauty. Applies easily, doesn’t feel sticky and wearable under makeup. I wear it alone and it saves time in the morning knowing that I’m putting on my serum AND spf at the same time! New re-purchase! Product was given to me complimentary from Murad for an honest review. SO SILKY! Serum and SPF combo saves me time
