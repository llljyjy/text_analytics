I saw the crow’s feet decrease. It is complementary from Murad Skincare. When applied, the skin feels a bit refreshing and soft. Also, I was using it on the frown lines on my forehead and around the mouth and I didn’t see any noticeable improvement, I only saw them on the fine lines. It may be that you have not been using it for a long time and the effect is long term. nan
