I love this! Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, you’re instantly protected once you apply it. No need to wait 15 minutes before going outside. I am a woman of color and this leaves almost no white cast. I have a pretty extensive skincare routine, and this works perfects as a last step. It plays well with others. No pilling, clumping or irritation. nan
