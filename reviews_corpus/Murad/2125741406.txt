i was excited to try this product after a year of not using retinol because i was pregnant and had a baby and boy did i miss retinol! i like the way this stuff smells, it has a light sort of citrusy scent to it and it’s more of a lotion rather than an oil which i prefer. so far so good- i use retinol for preventative reasons rather than to get rid of wrinkles, so it’s hard sometimes to know what works but it feels great and so far no wrinkles! missed my retinol!
