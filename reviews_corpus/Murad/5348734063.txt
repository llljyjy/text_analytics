This product is okay. It definitely blurs out fine lines when it’s initially applied, but once you add a moisturizer on top of it they appear again and I did wait until it dried as it said. They may be a little less noticeable, but I don’t believe it’s anything substantial to make this product worth buying. I was really looking forward to trying this because the lines on my forehead are a pain point of mine, but I don’t think it does anything more than a blurring primer. I was gifted it in exchange for a review. I attached photos to show what my lines look like before the corrector, after and after I put moisturizer on top. Eh, it's ok I suppose
