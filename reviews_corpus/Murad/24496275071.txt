I have been using this Murad Retinol serum for the past two weeks and here are my thoughts : - skin felt smooth after a couple of uses - I gave a a glowy look the next morning - fine lines looked visibly reduced with a week of use - it did not feel strong on my skin or cause any sort of irritation - I loved that there was no fragrance to it My skin loved all the after effects Amazing serum
