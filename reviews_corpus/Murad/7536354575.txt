I did see a difference after using this for about five months almost every day. I am not a fan of the smell. It does not smell good at all and I had to hold my breath when I put it on. It ended up going away after a bit. It also felt sticky and felt like I couldn’t layer with my makeup well. But, I guess it did it’s job, which is what I wanted it to do. The darker skin was me in May right before I started, and then lighter skin was just in December after using it for nearly half a year. nan
