I really enjoyed using this sunscreen. When you first apply it does feel a little oily but after absorbed it only gives a nice glow and no oily feeling and no white cast. I also noticed I didn’t get any sunburns so I’m happy with the results so far from using it. really protects the skin and leaves a nice glow
