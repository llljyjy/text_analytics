Constantly having acne leaves dark spots on my skin as well as the sun too. MURAD Gifted me a bottle of Rapid Dark Spot Correcting Serum and I am beyond happy with the results I am already noticing.  It has a light, gel like consistency and a little is all you need. Itâ€™s gentle enough that I can use both day and night too. It took a little over a week but I am seeing them slowly get lighter and fade. I noticed my skin looked brighter after the first few days. I am definitely going to keep this in my daily routine and recommend for all. Just remember to always wear your SPF while using. Results You Can See
