This is a great product for deep pimples! I have used the Mario Badescu drying lotion in the past (which is a similar concept), and I like this one a lot more for multiple reasons. It dries clear so you can actually put it on and wear it throughout the day and there is no bothersome scent. It also does soothe the area like the product says, and I noticed a significant difference after consistent applications; however, it is still a little bit drying for me, so I just try to stay moisturized! I was pleasantly surprised by the results :) This product was gifted to me by Murad Skincare, but all opinions are my own. Does what it says!
