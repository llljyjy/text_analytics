I am always on the hunt for an eye cream and was glad to try this one out. I like that there’s an applicator so that you can massage area while applying the cream. It takes some time to absorb in but it is hydrating and doesn’t feel too heavy. I don’t expect a product to remove wrinkles in a short amount of time but the hydration does improve the overall appearance.  Will continue using this eye cream. nan
