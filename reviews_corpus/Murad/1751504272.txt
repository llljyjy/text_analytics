I love Murad, especially for their acne products - but was interested in trying their wrinkle product! I love the applicator which is reminiscent of an undereye moisturizer, but now for the face! It goes on very smoothly on the face and when you first put it on, you can already feel the hydration going into your skin. It is refreshing! After about a week, my skin definitely feels more hydrated and plump. Havent seen major differences in wrinkles. Great product!
