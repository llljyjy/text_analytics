I like the consistency of this product as it’s lightweight and feels like a skincare serum, not spf, but I still break out which is frustrating because I can’t find a good non toxic spf that will be good for my sensitive acne prone skin. If you don’t have breakouts though you should try this. It did make me oily though. Give it a 6/10
