I am a huge sucker for eye masks. They are my favorite type of face masks in general so I have tried a good amount. For starters this is a great eye mask for sure, I especially love the size of the masks themselves. The retinol in it really felt like it helped my under eyes. The only drawback I would say is the price, it is a bit steep. But if you want to treat yourself this is a a good one to pick up from Sephora. nan
