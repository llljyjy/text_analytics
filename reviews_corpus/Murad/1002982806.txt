I am loving this spf. I use it on its own and under makeup. It has such a nice soft silky texture and rubs into the skin very nicely! I would 100% recommend and re purchase. Murad always has the next sunscreens. Zero white cast and no white residue or pilling ever! I havenâ€™t used it to re apply but I think it would have been fine to re apply throughout the day! I have sensitive eyes and this did not irritate or burn at all. One of my favorite sunscreens ever
