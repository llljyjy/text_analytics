I was gifted by Murad skincare this serum for reviewing purposes! This serum is phenomenal! I love retinol serums, it did not irritate my skin or peel, no increased sensitivity in my skin, i wake up to glowing nourished skin! My skin literally looks like glass in the morning after applying at night! It’s texture is like a cream and absorbs quickly to the skin, it smells amazing and clean! It’s my new favorite! Highly recommended Glass skin in the morning! Great serum
