I really like how light weight this sunscreen is! It doesn’t run into the eyes and does not leave a white cast. It blends like a dream and does not pill under makeup. It doesn’t feel greasy at all either! I love using this under makeup or even when I am too lazy to rub in cream type of sunscreen. Really great! Great lightweight sunscreen!
