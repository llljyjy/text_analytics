I tried these for the first time last night and I wasn’t sure if I was going to like them. I’ve had irritation from retinol under eye cream before, and they started to feel pretty intense by the end of the 15 minutes. When I took them off everything looked fine. This morning my under eyes looked absolutely amazing! The skin is plump and super juicy. The shape of these is amazing. They are huge which helps get the tiny fine lines that go out closer to your hairline. Now the only downside to me is the price. At $10, this might be more of an indulgence to some people. I look at sheet masks as more of a treat product. Just in general they are pretty wasteful because of all the packaging. That’s just me though. I will definitely keep these in mind if I have an event coming up because these worked so incredibly well! Amazing for events
