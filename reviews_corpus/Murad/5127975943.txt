I’m extremely oily, my nose gets shiny after just an hour without any product in the summer. This held up just slightly better than my regular routine with baking as well but at around 2 hours I started oiling through. From the reviews I was expecting more.I also experienced pilling but only when I rubbed it in too much. I found that once I’ve gotten it visibly blended in to just leave it to self-set otherwise it would pill. If using makeup on top I don’t recommend buffing but rather using a beauty blending or tapping with a brush in light layers. It’s not bad product but at its price point and tube size, it’s way overpriced in my opinion. Being a sunscreen you can’t even be sparing with it and you’ll likely run through it in a month or so and at $70 after tax… the performance is not reasonable. Maybe it would be good for a slightly oily/combination skin. Not worth the price.
