I’ve been using this spf for a while now (I’m on like my 4th bottle) and I really liked it but I feel like the more I keep using it, the more it pills on me. First and second bottles were great but I feel like after the second, all I get is pilling, which totally looks like dead skin shedding due to my skin tone. So now I need to find a new spf :( Pilling alert
