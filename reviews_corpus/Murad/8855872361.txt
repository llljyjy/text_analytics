I have been using this product for a week and it was gifted by murad skincare. It helps reduce my pimples, not by a lot, but it makes them not as red and painful. The texture is nice and so is the bottle. I do wish it had a pump or a dropper though so I wouldnâ€™t have to dump it on my hands or stick my finger or a application tool into the product. nan
