This is the best vit C product I’ve used. It’s effective, and doesn’t have a strong odor. One small pump is all you need, and be sure to rub it in so any layers going over it don’t pill. I use this after my shower in the AM (no face wash) and then either add a light moisturizer or go right to SPF. I’ve tried other vit C creams and nothing compares. One star off for the price and excess packaging which makes it more difficult to travel with. perfect product, imperfect price and packaging
