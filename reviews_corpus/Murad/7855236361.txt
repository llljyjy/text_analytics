I was super excited to find a dark spot, corrector with SPS. I love to, and one products. this left my skin, feeling very moisturized and looking brighter. it uses mineral zinc oxide for the sunscreen and it has an invisible finish on my skin. it also contains beat root extract that is hydrating and. stimulates vitamin d production. I was gifted this by Murad skincare. nan
