I donâ€™t typically use Murads skincare line but when I came across this product I had to try it. I love that an active ingredient is Zinc Oxide which protects my skin from all the UV rays. The bottle is easy to use for a sunscreen and I love the dropper. When applying the product it does go on white so I need to really rub it in without any residue. This product feels so clean and has protected my skin when being at the pool all day. nan
