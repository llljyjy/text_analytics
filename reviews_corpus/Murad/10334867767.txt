It’s a great retinol serum even for beginners as it contains Hyaluronic acid which also hydrated the skin. It might leave the skin a bit dry so following up with a thick moisturizer is recommended. It works great to improve skin’s texture and also works great to reduce the appearance of fine line. I didn’t face any irritation or purging with this serum. A product worth trying. Great for beginners. No irritation or purging
