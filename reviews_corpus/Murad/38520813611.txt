The sunscreen itself is a 10/10 it’s lightweight, moisturizing, leaves no white cast, and doesn’t sting my eyes. I also appreciate that this has a high UVA protection rating. Here are some cons I think the price is rather high for a sunscreen especially with the amount you need to use. It’s hard to measure out the proper amount (I use the three finger method) it would be better if it had pump packaging and told you how many pumps to use. Overall it is an amazing sunscreen and if the price point and packaging doesn’t bother you i would definitely recommend it. Good sunscreen but pricey
