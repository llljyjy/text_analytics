I purchased the Murad retinol serum in store, so I haven’t read any reviews about this product prior. I wish I knew that there is shimmer in this product, otherwise, I wouldn’t have bought it. Why would I need shimmer on while I am sleeping? The product looks great immediately but maybe it’s the shimmer. I’m going to be returning this product to try something without shimmer. Didn't like it!
