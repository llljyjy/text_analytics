This is really good. Love it so far.  Gave me a beautiful, very subtle sheen.  Lightweight texture. Absorbed fast, not oily, no white cast.  No teary eyes.  My skin looks prettier wearing it alone. Helps my foundation looks nicer as well.  I have dry and sensitive skin.  Cons: havenâ€™t test it in the real, hot vacation sun yet.  And it is pricey. Love it
