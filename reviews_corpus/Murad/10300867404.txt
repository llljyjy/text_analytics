I have used murad’s products in the past because I got some in different beauty boxes. I have fairly sensitive skin and didn’t react so I decided to try them again since it was complimentary from Murad skincare. It took a few days but I did start to see a difference in my acne. I use this as spot treatment when I go to sleep at night and it has helped minimize the amount of breakouts I have. nan
