I was impressed by this product! Most things I have used that claim to reduce appearance of lines just don’t. This actually worked. I’m fairly young but I have a pretty prominent line coming up from my eyebrow, and it looked smaller and finer after applying this product. This is a temporary effect, and I can’t speak to long term effects of the product. Good stuff
