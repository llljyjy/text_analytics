*gifted by Murad* I like this eye mask, and my eyes felt hydrated and looked nice after using. But, I just don’t think these are an sustainable  way to approach under eye skincare. They’re very expensive and I just didn’t see that big of a difference. I would prefer an every night eye cream that helps my skin over time. I wouldn’t purchase these. nan
