I never knew I needed a 2 in 1 sunscreen until I found this product. This product was very moisturizing for my dry skin without that ‘super slick sunscreen’ feeling. Most importantly, no hyperpigmentation!!! I love the consistency of this product. To know that I am not only protecting my skin but also improving my hyperpigmentation is amazing!!!! I’ve seen a few of my dark marks improve slightly but I will keep trying it out to see if they fade. Melanin Approved!!
