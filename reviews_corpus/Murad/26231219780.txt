I really liked the product.  Retinol generally helps a lot in the fight against skin aging.  but itâ€™s very hard to pick it up.  I tried retinol from different brands, but most of all I liked this one from Murad.  I put it on at night before bed after toner.  it smooths out micro wrinkles very well.  It really hydrates the skin and you can see how it works!  it also does not clog pores and pores look even smaller in the morning. Best hydration!
