Always on the hunt for new sunscreens, this mineral sunscreen from Murad caught my eye because of the higher SPF and PA ++++ additional coverage. You MUST shake before applying - because the consistency is almost watery, I appreciate application is in dropper form. No white cast or sunscreen smell, but it does leave an oily sheen that persists throughout the day. I don’t mind because I like the glowy look but if I want to apply makeup over, I will most likely go for another sunscreen. Nice to try if you have the $$ but you won’t die without it! nan
