This is a fast-acting serum that combines 3 retinol technologies & hyaluronic acid. What is the Retinol tri-active technology? This innovation balances a potent, fast-acting retinol with a time released retinol that works like a slow-down, feeding retinol gradually to minimize irritation and maximize visible results. And a booster amplifies retinol’s ability to increase cell turnover, one of retinol’s key actions for more youthful looking skin, fewer fine lines, and enhanced radiance. Good for all skin types. Retinol has so many benefits for the skin such as preventing and smoothing the look of fine lines and wrinkles, brightening dull skin, and even skin tone. Great product!
