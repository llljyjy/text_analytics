Im always on the hunt for an effective and comfortable serum for dark spots/PIH. Love how lightweight this serum is, no sticky or greasy feeling. I like how it has Glycolic acid (which I’m used to) and another great brightening ingredient Tranexamic Acid. I didn’t feel any irritation at all. But for first time users of acids, I suggest do a patch test or apply in small amount first. Easy to layer and incorporate in my routine. My face looks brighter and smoother with continuous use. #giftedbymurad #complimentary Gentle, brightening serum
