The product is fine. The packaging is horrible. The pump will stop pumping out product making you think its empty. I pried it open with pliers and its got about a months worth of product inside still. Dont buy this until they change the packaging, thereâ€™s better vit-c serum packaging from other brands that you can actually get all the product you paid for out. Dont buy this from Murad
