I’ve tried so many different eye masks and most don’t work. I can honestly say these Murad Retinol eye masks really do work and I absolutely love them. I noticed results very quickly after a short period of time. I love that they are so large and cover a good amount of area. They stay put and don’t slip when I’m moving around.  I like to out mine in the fridge to give them a cooling feel, it feels amazing. Since using them, my under eyes are less puffy, dark circles are fading, much brighter tone, and lines are starting to disappear.  I’m so excited to continue using these eye masks and seeing even more results.  My only issue is they are pretty pricey. Finally eye masks that work!!
