I received this Product complimentary for my review and I’ve been using it for a few weeks now . So far I’m really enjoying it. It’s super hydrating, goes on smoothly and doesn’t irritate my sensitive eye area. No strong fragrance, which is great. The applicator makes it easy to apply & price point is good. I can’t speak to the long term benefits but I’ll continue to use it! nan
