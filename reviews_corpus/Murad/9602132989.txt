I’ve received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I’ve tried a few things from Murad and I’ve really liked them everything has worked and done exactly what it claims so I’m sure this will too. I haven’t really noticed a change in my skin, I have really bad under-eyes so I’m going to continue using it there and hopefully they’re will be a noticeable change, that being said we only get 2 weeks to try the product before a review is due, so I think with a bit more time I will see results. Definitely not an “overnight” products. Also I would not pay full price for this, as a college student it’s just way out of budget. nan
