I’m very hesitant to try mineral sunscreens as I have a long list of must-haves that very few meet. This one from Murad is one of the best I’ve tried! It’s very liquidy and glides onto the skin easily. It looks a bit greasy, so I recommend topping with a powder. I have pale skin and did not experience any whitecast. I also have acne-prone skin and found that this did not break me out. A solid option for those wanting a mineral SPF! nan
