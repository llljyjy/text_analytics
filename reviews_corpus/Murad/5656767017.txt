I received this serum complimentary from Murad Skincare for my honest review. A great product with not so accessible packaging. I’m a fan of the other products from this line and was excited to give this a try! This is a thin acne serum with salicylic acid to help unclog pores and treat blemishes. The formula absorbs quickly and find that this reduces really difficult acne within 48 hours of consistent use. My only gripe is the packaging. I have to use a q-tip to dispense without contamination. In spite of that, it’s still a bomb product! Great For Hormonal Acne
