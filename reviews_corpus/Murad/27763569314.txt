This is what I am looking for to protect my skin from sun damage and also helps my skin to fight with the hyperpigmentation which that’s one of my biggest problems. This Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 has milky liquid texture, super easy spread on the skin, it’s also great to wear under the makeup. Highly recommended. Highly recommended!!
