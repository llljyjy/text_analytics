[Gifted by Murad] I love trying out new SPFs and so was really excited to see this one by Murad. It has more of a watery, serum like texture and is really comfortable to wear. There was no white cast on my skin, despite it containing zinc oxide. The only drawback Iâ€™ve seen is that it is quite expensive. nan
