I was very intrigues by the design of the tube tip when I saw this product online, upon opening and using the product, the tip is actually an applicator that works to apply the product! It feels great on the skin and evenly distributes the product onto the area you are targeting. I sepcifically wanted to target crows feet and the applicator worked well in that delicate area. I like that the product does not have a scent and that it absorbed easily into my skin. I followed the package directions that said you may tap the product into the skin after using the applicator but I feel that I did not need to do this as the applicator did a great job and the product had already absorbed. Great targeted serum for wrinkles!
