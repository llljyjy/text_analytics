Okay so I have pretty sensitive skin, especially sensitive to Vitamin C (and retinol is a form of vit c!!) so when this said you could use it nightly, I was skeptical. But I almost can. I can use it every other night, at least, for sure. It’s gentle enough for that, which means it’s gentle enough for daily use for regular skin persons. Definitely only use at night, and wear sunscreen the next day if it’s sunny or summer !! Retinol is a complex ingredient and you have to be careful. But this is a great product and a great form of retinol if you’re looking to get into that. Im 22, so not mature wrinkles, but I do have forehead wrinkles forming (booooo) and after a week of use, they honestly were much less obvious. I used thick moisturizer after applying this to really lock it in. Gentle!
