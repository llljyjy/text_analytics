I’ve been waiting a while to get micro-needling and have been trying really hard to keep my acne under control, since you can’t get micro-needling if you have an active breakout. About a week before my appointment, I got an intense hormonal breakout around my mouth and chin. While my usual remedies were helping, they work slowly and I needed something immediate. Luckily, I stumbled upon this product on TikTok, went to Sephora, and after two days of use, my acne already nearly gone. It’s definitely intense and might irritate sensitive skin if you don’t use it really sparingly, and it smells awful, but it works! A Life-Saver
