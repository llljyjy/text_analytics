I love the Murad skincare line and I can already tell that the addition of the Retinol Youth Renewal Serum to my skincare routine is going to be a big game changer!First impressions: The Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Serum comes in a nice looking and easy to use cylindrical plastic bottle with a pump on top. I like the plastic bottle packaging because I have tile floors and have learned that glass packaging is not my friend. The serum promises to help revitalize the skin and aid in a more youthful appearance with retinol being one of the key ingredients.I found that the Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Serum has a very light lotion like consistency that easily spreads and absorbs quickly into the skin. The serum is very hydrating and absorbs without leaving any residue or tackiness which also gives an immediate improvement to the skin’s more finer wrinkles. I also noticed that unlike some other products that contain retinol, this serum didn’t cause any peeling (which happens with some retinol products) so it might be something someone with sensitive skin might want to try. (I want to note that I have oily-combination skin and have been using this product for a week.)Overall, I really like the Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Serum and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve the texture of their skin immediately and long term. Great retinol product
