Having fair, skin cancer prone skin, one of the most important things to me is SPF.  So, when I saw this 2-in-1 product, both protecting and correcting my skin, I knew it was going to be perfect for me! I love the way it feels on my skin- its lightweight and doesn’t seem oily throughout the day like other SPF products can be.  Murad is one of my favorite skin care brands, and I’m so happy to add this to the list of products from Murad that I love. nan
