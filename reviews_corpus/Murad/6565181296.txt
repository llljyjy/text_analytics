Every eye cream/serum i tried before felt like I was just paying for under expensive eye moisturizer and while this one is pricey, it’s the only one I go back to. Great for puffiness and you can feel its tightening effects. I still use dr. Brandt on top of it if I’ve had a late or sleepless night and I need the extra assist for my dark circles but otherwise this absolutely does the trick day to day and a little goes a long way so I can use it day and night. the only eye product I keep going back to
