Have been suffering with mild cystic acne for quite some time. Not only is the active acne really hard to manage, itâ€™s the dark & deep scars that really take a toll on your skin. I seen this advertisement on Instagram and the name of the product instantly caught my eye! I also purchased their deep acne relief treatment and I have never loved my skin as I do now! My skin has been  acne free for almost a week and my dark pitted scars are fading! My texture has been an issue too & finally I can start seeing some smoothness! I used to be a consistent Niaminicide user and I have never seen results like this! Thank you Murad!!! I will keep this in my routine as long as I can! nan
