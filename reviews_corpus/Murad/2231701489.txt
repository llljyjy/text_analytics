I have been testing the Murad Targeted Wrinkle Corrector in exchange for my honest opinion. I wish I took better care of my skin growing up but I’ve always been a beach bunny and the sun has affected my skin. This corrector makes it easy to apply to specific areas of your face. The metal tío feels cool against your skin and it gives the appearance of removing your fine lines. Nice and cool tip
