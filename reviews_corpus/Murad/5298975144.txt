I’ve been using this for a week now, which is a bit soon to comment, however, this product workssss. It has helped decrease my texture and reduce my pores, and drastically minimize the look and feel of my sebacious filaments, which I’ve struggled with. I have sensitive skin, and I find it does not irritate it, however, it does have a very fine grit texture, so if you are sensitive, use *gentle* pressure and “dissolve“ it a bit with water in your hands before applying to your face, and you should be ok. I also tend to have sensitive skin right around the sides of my nose and mouth, so I generally avoid those areas as well, because it felt a little tight when I applied it. If you have super dry or reactive skin - might want to avoid, I have balanced/combo skin, but I can see how with frequent/extended use it could potentially be drying. Also, a few times a week is more than enough. I’ve been applying it for 30 sec or more, and I let it sit on my nose itself for a few extra seconds before rinsing it off. A little goes a long way + the bottle is pretty big. If you are not able to use a leave-on salicylic acid treatment because it’s too harsh, I would try this. Texture and Sebacious Filaments - this is for you!
