I received this vitamin C serum complimentary from Murad and I’ve been using it religiously in my morning and nighttime skincare routine, I love the consistency of it and how fast my skin absorbs it, it leaves my skin super soft and I’ve been noticing some of my dark spots fading already, my face has been brighter and overall more radiant, I can see myself purchasing it after I run out of it, I would definitely recommend it A must have for anyone’s skincare routine
