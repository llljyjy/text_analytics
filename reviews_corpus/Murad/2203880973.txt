This is a really nice sunscreen. It’s extremely fluid and runny, so you have to be careful when you apply. It feels so lightweight yet when you put it on it feels greasy for the first ten minutes before the sunscreen “sets” but once it does it stays out and feels great. The white cast isn’t noteable on me, but I have pretty fair skin. Definitely not good for oily skin but dry skin people will love this. I think it’s a really good product but the bottle is so small for such an expensive product that it loses a star. Murad - Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45|
