Gifted by Murad Skincare! I absolutely love everything there’s brand stands for! This was a very exciting lunch for me because I do have zits and acne on my face! I have tried dozens of spa treatments on the market and honestly this is a very solid option, it actually reminds me of my favorite spot treatment by Kate Somerville that utilizes pretty much the same packaging! I will say this though this product is really expensive for a spot treatment and it is definitely a treat, I would buy this product if you’re looking for a new experience in terms of spa treatments and if you really want to try the brand! nan
