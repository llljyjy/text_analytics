Iâ€™ve been so in love with this! It really feels like a good murdering serum upon application. It sinks into the skin beautifully and leaves a satin finish. I love the way my make up sits on top and I believe I am seeing an overall healthier look to my skin as I use this more and more. I highly recommend this for dry skin or anyone who dislikes traditional sunscreens. Obsessed
