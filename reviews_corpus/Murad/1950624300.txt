I have been using this spf since I got it in the mail. I love the serum consistency and enjoyed the dropper applicator.  It smells ok. Smells like a spf to be honest. But I do like how hydrating it felt on my skin after. For a dry skin girl that’s a plus. It also wears well under makeup. And I love everything that comes in a glass bottle since I feel it preserves the product better. Not ideal for travel but that’s ok it ca be transferred to a small travel bottle. Overall I really like this and I’m so picky with my spf. Great spf for dry skin girls
