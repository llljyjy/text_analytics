Murad gifted me their Correct and Protect Serum with SPF 45 in exchange for my honest review.  This product helps to correct discoloration and prevent hyperpigmentation while it protects with 100% mineral SPF.  Key ingredients include Zinc Oxide (16.7%) which protects against UVA, UVB, blue light and pollution, UV-Responsive Carotenoid Technology which contains jojoba, squalene, and tomato fruit extract blend to deliver antioxidant defense and absorbs UV light and reflects it for a natural glow, and beet root extract to infuse skin with hydration and stimulate vitamin D production.  I like that it is fragrance free.  It does not contain parabens, sulfates, phthalates, gluten, mineral oil, formaldehyde, petrolatum, oxybenzone or animal derived ingredients. I like the Zinc Oxide percentage to protect my fair skin from the sun. I shake it up well, as instructed, to make sure the consistency is distributed throughout the product.  I place a few drops directly onto my facial skin and gently rub it in with my fingers.  It is a white milky like serum that melts into my skin. It does leave my skin a little greasy like sunscreen. It does not leave any whitecast.  It leaves my skin glowing and I feel protected from the sunâ€™s harmful rays. nan
