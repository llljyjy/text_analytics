I believe I received a defective product, so I can’t say if it’s a fluke or if there are many like this. But when I opened the package, there was only one eye mask inside, not a pair of two. As I am not a cyclops, I wasn’t able to use the product at all. Definitely a waste of money if you’re only getting one eye mask and not a pair. (And yes, I searched the entire packet and pulled apart every piece of mesh — there was only one piece included.) only received one piece?
