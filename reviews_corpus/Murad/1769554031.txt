I have always suffer from hormonal acne, not severe but once a month I get the pimples. I have tried different treatments but some ineffective. I received the cream complimentary by Murad  and after using it for a week twice a day I started noticing my pimples getting smaller and drying. It works great!I can use makeup after using the cream and it looks good. Highly recommended. Pimples started getting smaller and drying!!
