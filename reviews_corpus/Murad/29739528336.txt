Murad is my go-to brand for sunscreens and so I was so excited when I saw this was a skincare and sunscreen in one. Itâ€™s very lightweight and blends nicely into my skin, and layers well underneath my makeup. I love how this is SPF 45 because I live in a sunny area and the extra protection is a bonus. I also have some discoloration and dark spots and this is perfect for my skincare problems. nan
