I feel like my acne doesn’t respond that well with Salicylic Acid (is it just me or everyone else too?) However I still use acne product like this one on my painful chin pimple hoping that ‘this one’ will do magic. Sadly the pimple doesn’t vanish overnight but I feel like I am doing something good for it. Perhaps it does speed up the course of the pimple recovery journey by a day or two.
