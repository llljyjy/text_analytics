To begin with I donâ€™t have severe acne but this treatment works great for those pimples that come occasionally. I love how it helps to calm inflammation and reduce redness. I usually apply it at night to the target area and the result is noticeable the next morning. It takes several days to eliminate the pimple completely though. All in all it works great for me! nan
