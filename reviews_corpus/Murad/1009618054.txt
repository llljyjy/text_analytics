Here is my review on the Correct & Protect Serum Broad Spectrum SPF45 that Murad sent me. First, my skin is sensitive and easily irritated. First, the texture is so lightweight & feels just like a milky serum. It feels so nice on the skin and this hasn’t caused any reaction. I’m kind of obsessed with this sunscreen and will definitely be repurchasing. 1 star off for the price. Sensitive skin
