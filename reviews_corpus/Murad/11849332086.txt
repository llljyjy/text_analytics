I got the sample and it is wonderful! I have terrible skin lately, lots of acne, lots of irritation-little bumps and itchiness, and dull skin. I used this serum in the night time and the next morning my skin already looked better. I have been looking for a retinol product that will not irritate my skin and this is it. Iâ€™m going to buy the full product because this is the first product that has actually worked for me. nan
