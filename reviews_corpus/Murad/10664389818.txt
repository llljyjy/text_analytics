The 2 in 1 Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 from Murad Skincare comes in sleek packaging. It contains beet root extract, squalene, and tomato extract. I applied this serum during AM skincare and it was hydrating. My skin felt bright and happy after using it. It’s easy to apply and the sun protection with SPF 45 is like an added bonus. It’s paraben and sulfate free. nan
