I first off I love the packaging. The airless pump makes it easy to know you’ve got every last hit of this out. And it’s pretty pricey so it’s Nice to know that you will get every last drop out. I am also really happy that there isnt much of a string scent although there is a scent. in this product it’s really good for my dry skin that I have right now without getting too overly sensitive in this cold climate right now. It layers really well with other skin care products and it hasn’t made me break out which I really enjoy it as well I will continue using this until I finish it up I really really like it nan
