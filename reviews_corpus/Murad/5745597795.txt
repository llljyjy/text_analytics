The murad deep relief acne treatment really helped me get rid of those deep hurting acne. I hated when I would get deep acne because it always hurt and was uncomfortable. Iâ€™m so happy I found this product because it helped solve this issue. I would apply it in the morning and at night everyday. The results took a couple days, but eventually it worked. I was gifted this product by Murad skincare, but I would buy it myself! I love it!
