I personally love Murad as a brand. This product did not disappoint. It does have fragrance but did not irritate my skin. I’m in my late 20s, so this was the perfect gentle yet effective retinol to begin with. My mom loves it. It’s great to begin using retinol with. Did not cause me to breakout or dry my skin out Love this retinol
