I love this sunscreen! It starts off a little greasy but it sets into your skin. The zinc is also so great for cystic acne. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an easy-to-apply and effective sunscreen. It’s super expensive but it’s worth it and doesn’t make my skin pill. Expensive but worth it
