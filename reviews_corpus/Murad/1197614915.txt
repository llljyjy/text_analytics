This product was gifted by Murad. This is a quite thick cream that you apply in a line and then rub in with the metal tip before smoothing in with fingertips. I really enjoyed the application process. It felt luxurious and the metal tip really felt great and helped to smooth it in nicely. I did notice an immediate result in the appearance of fine lines but I havenâ€™t noticed any lasting results as of yet. It does lay nicely under makeup and other skincare products. I appreciate the squeeze tube packaging also as I feel you can get the most out of it. Feels great!
