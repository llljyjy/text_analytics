Such a great feeling product on the skin with so many benefits! I try to stay away from creamy and thick sunscreens as no matter what, they donâ€™t look good with our without makeup. This one is a life saver as its a sheer and smooth finish and not only protects skin but also helps correct some of the damage or hyperpigmentation. A winner in my books! Must have in my routine
