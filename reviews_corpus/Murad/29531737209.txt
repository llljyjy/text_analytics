I am absolutely in love with this! I am picky when it comes to SPF and this one checked off all the boxes for me. I love the lightweight texture of it. It doesnâ€™t feel heavy on the skin and absorbed really well. It works well on its own and under makeup, I had zero issues with pilling. My skin is looking brighter and more even after using it! Great SPF
