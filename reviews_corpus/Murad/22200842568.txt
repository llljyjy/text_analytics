pretty nice serum, i felt a nice cooling affect on my skin and somewhat made my acne less than it usually is.  although i liked this serum, my only complaint is that the packaging is kind of inconvenient because there isnâ€™t a pump or anything and i found it hard to get the product out.  * gifted by Murad Skincare * lovely serum but not a huge fan of the packaging
