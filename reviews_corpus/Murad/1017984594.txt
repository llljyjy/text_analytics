With any retinol I won’t see any results this soon but so far I haven’t experienced any irritation. I’ve been using it every two days so I can adjust my skin to it just in case . I’m not a big fan of the fragrance scent that’s perfume like in it but it’s not a deal breaker. It did leave my skin feeling really soft and plump in the mornings . So far so good !
