My go-to cleanser! I’ve been dealing with acne since my early teens (26 now) and since I started using the cream cleanser it’s cleared up my acne completely. I still get the odd cystic bump but that’s because of my diet/hormones. The cream cleanser is less drying than the regular one, but you’ll still need a good moisturizer afterwards. I’ve been using Dr. Jart’s Teatreement moisturizer with this product for over a year now and i have no complaints. Miracle worker!
