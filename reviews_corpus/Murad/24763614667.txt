I received this product complimentary from Murad Skincare and have been absolutely delighted with it. I have had acne-prone skin since I was about 15 years old and now that I am older I still struggle with the occasional spark of acne here and there. I love using this product because it attacks the pimple directly and the salicylic acid is great for those stubborn pimples. I apply the product at night and have noticed my skin looks healthier. Iâ€™d definitely recommend this product. nan
