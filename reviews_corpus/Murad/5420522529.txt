Murad has been an iconic brand for many years. I am now in my early 30s and have noticed some fine lines on my forehead and my smile lines. This is why I was excited to try this anti-aging treatment! The consistency is very unique as it reminds me of a mousse. I was skeptical to believe that it instantly plumps fine lines but it really does visibly plump within minutes. With that said the instant plumping effect only lasted for about an hour for me though I am looking forward to seeing the results after a few weeks of use. I also love that this Murad product is cruelty-free. nan
