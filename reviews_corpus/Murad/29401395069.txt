I’ve enjoyed the creamy, milky consistency of this product. It has no scent. It blends well into the skin. The packaging is very attractive and upscale looking. It’s in an attractive glass container. It contains 17% Zinc Oxide and it’s a wonderful SPF cream. I spread it over my face and neck as a final step to my skincare routine, before applying make-up. It blends easily into the skin. Would recommend! Works well! Love it!
