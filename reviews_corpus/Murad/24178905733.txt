These are so juicy which I really like. I especially love that they didn’t slide around once I got them in place. My eyes didn’t get watery like some eye patches have done in the last. I do think they are expensive as one treatment is 10 dollars. My eyes were less puffy the next morning after using them the night before so they did work well for me. I would recommend them for a splurge eye treat. Pricey but works
