It doesn’t work. I was really excited to use this product because I got the sample size bottle of the face cleanser so I thought I give this a shot. Yes it feels silky smooth when applied to your cleaned face. And also not much product is needed when applying. I use it for about 2 months and I haven’t seen any results using it every night. It’s No good , I wasted my money. No results with nightly use.
