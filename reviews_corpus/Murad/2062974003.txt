I’m 34 with ‘normal’ skin but am getting to the point where I really want to prevent any fine lines from forming on my face. This is the first time I’ve tried retinol in a serum and I liked it! My face appeared smoother and more vibrant after using this product for about 2 weeks. I didn’t see a reduction in the imperfections I already have, but I also didn’t notice any new ones. I’m excited to keep playing with this to see how it works. nan
