I have dry skin with some sensitive areas and I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks. I can tell my dry skin has improved and my face looks smoother and healthier. I’ve had no problem with irritation from this product. It does have a light fragrance which I don’t mind. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a sticky finish. So far I’m very pleased. It’s working on my dry skin
