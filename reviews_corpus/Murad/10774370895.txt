My first review, because I couldn’t not talk about how good this is! I was out of the country for work for two months, in a place that was incredibly hot and everyone still wore masks outside so out of respect I did the same but the heat and sweat and stress from work broke out my cheeks and chin in a way I have never in my 39yrs experienced. It was so bad I cried about it because I didn’t want to show my face. Once I got the breakout under control, I was left with terrible scarring, and I decided to try this; I have now cried over the wonders its done for my face! I got the small bottle first and saw enough of a difference to commit to the big bottle; I only use three pumps at night (my skin is still sensitive so I don’t want to push using this when I’m in the sun) but it’s already made such a huge difference and I couldn’t be more thankful! I have combo skin, used to get cystic acne, and am brown skinned and prone melasma, and this product more than any other I have tried has brought an even, bright tone to my skin. Highly recommend.
