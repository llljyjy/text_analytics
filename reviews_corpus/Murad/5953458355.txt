I’ve struggled with dark spots for a long time because of acne scarring. I’ve already started to notice improvement in the appearance of those spots and I’ve only been using this treatment for 14 days. I apply enough to cover the spots and rub it in well 3 nights a week. The treatment itself is lightweight in texture, like a gel/cream combo. It absorbs thoroughly within a matter of about 60 seconds. It works it’s magic while I sleep, and I wake up to noticeably improved dark spots! I can’t recommend it enough. Great for acne scars
