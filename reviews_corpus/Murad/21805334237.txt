Love this cleanser. It’s been a while since I’ve used it but my skin feels so fresh and clean after using and not too dried out. Works great with other products as well. I use this cleanser about two to three times a week in accordance with another simpler cleanser that’s not as exfoliating just to give my skin a break. nan
