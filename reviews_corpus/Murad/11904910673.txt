Unfortunately I didn’t really enjoy this sunscreen. PROS: it has a fluid consistency which makes blending easy and doesn’t leave a noticeable white cast on my skin tone (light). CONS: However, it’s extremely oily, and feels heavy like a dry oil sitting on my skin after application. Tacky feeling does subside after a while, but would steer clear if you have oilier/combination skin regardless. Pricey for a very mediocre product imo. Kinda greasy :(
