This really is a sunscreen that goes on like a serum. I like this format for applying sunscreen as it fits really easily into my skincare routine. It does go on white, but it blends in quite quickly, and I haven’t had any issues with layering with either skincare or makeup. It also doesn’t seem to have any scent whatsoever, which I appreciate! Hasn’t broken me out, either. Glad to have this one! nan
