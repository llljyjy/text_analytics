only gave them 4 stars because of the price. I love the size & non-slip on these under eye masks.  I was able to go about my morning routine without them sliding down my face! That’s huge when you’re a mom running around in the morning!I left them on for about 20 minutes & when I removed them, my skin felt smooth & hydrated. Makeup went on great. Really enjoying these! Really nice eye masks
