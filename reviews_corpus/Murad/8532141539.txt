This is a great SPF for days that you are just throwing on a sunscreen and leaving the house, but not so much if you wear any makeup on top of it. I brought it on my trip as my only sunscreen (big mistake!!!) and it pilled so badly after putting any concealer or foundation on top. Sucks because I actually love the soft matte finish of it alone, so I would assume it makes a great makeup primer. Great alone, horrible pilling with makeup
