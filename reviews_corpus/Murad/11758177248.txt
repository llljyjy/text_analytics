It works! As soon as you apply the product, it creates a filling effect on the fine lines. I loved it specially around the eyes. The texture is a little thick but it absorbs quickly and is invisible. The shape of the applicator is perfect for the job. I am very pleased overall. I just wish it were less pricey. nan
