I use SPF daily whether I am inside or outside. The packaging is great for getting the right amount of drops for your skin care routine! I have combination skin and I do not need to use moisturizer. It applies and absorbs seamlessly into my skin. It feels really hydrating on my skin. It did not make my skin feel or look greasy. I stay away from thick/creamy SPFS no matter what, because I know they donâ€™t look good without makeup and often pill. There is no fragrance in the product. I have worn makeup over this and it does not pill. This SPF shields from UV rays AND blue light! I am a teacher so I have been on the computer everyday. I am enthusiastic to continue using this in my skincare regimen. I genuinely recommend this if you are looking to brighten and correct skin tone, with a smooth finish! The Perfect Daily SPF!
