this is a great, beginner friendly retinol for those interested in incorporating the product into their routines! If you’ve struggled with acne like I have, this product will help with those dark marks or spots leftover! I’d say to give it about 2-3 weeks to see visible results but you will notice more life, brightness, etc added back to the skin! easy beginner retinol!
