I was hopeful when I saw the ingredients to these eye masks. My eye area could definitely use some retinol to diminish wrinkles and keep that area firm, but it doesn’t seem realistic to expect to see results in one use and I did not. It’s best to purchase 5 pairs to get a better idea of what these eye masks can do. The packaging was a bit on the messy side, but I really enjoyed the large size of these masks. I would try these again if the price was a bit lower. Great ingredients!
