It burns. And I use the extra strength peel pads with glycolic etc with zero irritation. I don’t know why a serum would burn sooo much (nothing else has been irritating me, have tried lots of new things this summer). It feels like the strong burn of straight alcohol on my face. ugh. it’s not like irritation after due to high strength ingredients like one might get with retinol... it’s burning on contact. not hives, not allergies, just uncomfortable to use. alcohol burn on application
