This is the second sunscreen I’ve tried from Murad’s Environmental Shield line and I love this one just as much as the other one. It’s a thin, milky texture that feels lightweight. It doesn’t leave a white cast and it doesn’t sting my eyes. I will definitely be repurchasing this spf next summer since it’s so lightweight. Fantastic!
