This serum and SPF hybrid is made with 100% mineral zinc-oxide to deliver the best defense against UVA, UVB, blue light, and pollution. Jojoba, Squalane, and tomato fruit extract provide antioxidant defense while absorbing and reflecting UV light to enhance your glow. Beet root extract helps give the skin long-lasting hydration and stimulates the production of Vitamin D. This serum does it all by both correcting existing hyperpigmentation and protecting the skin from more. The serum appears milky, has no real fragrance apart from the slight scent of zinc oxide, and when you apply it to the skin it goes on silky-smooth and leaves no white cast. I love the way it feels on my face, and I personally really loved the way my makeup looked when applied over it. It isn’t overly greasy either, so my foundation and other products didn’t move around on my face. This is just an all around beautiful mineral SPF serum and its great for all skin types as well! Love this formula!
