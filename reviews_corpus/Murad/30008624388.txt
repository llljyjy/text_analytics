I received this product complimentary from Murad Skincare to test and review. I tend to really like the feel and finish of sunscreen serums so I was not surprised that I liked this sunscreen a lot! It’s got a satin/natural finish that doesn’t feel too heavy or greasy. Definitely will continue to use this! Beautiful sunscreen serum!
