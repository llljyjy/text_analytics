wow!! i bought this, not expecting much, but wow. i have several dark spots/ post acne scars that i didn’t think could go away. after about two weeks of using this product, i’ve seen a major difference with my skin. less redness, very moisturized, fewer breakouts, and just overall brighter skin. if you’re on the edge about buying it, do it!! these products have also helped my acne. if you have dry skin, i’d also recommend the products, as they are highly moisturizing. i’m so impressed with the results i’ve seen so far, and i’m sure after a while my skin will be completely clear! consistency is key with this product! nan
