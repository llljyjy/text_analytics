I had a deep cystic acne/ingrown hair combination in my chin and this drew it out overnight. It was super tender and under the skin but by morning it had fully erupted to the surface. I was able to extract the hair and the cyst contents quickly and painlessly. Gifted by Murad skincare Brought out a deep cyst!
