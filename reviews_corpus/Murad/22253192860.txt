I am new to using retinol, but I definitely should’ve started sooner. I’m a huge Murad fan so this is definitely a product I trusted to use. It’s too soon to notice any long term benefits/improvements. But my experience so far has been great. I use one pump before my nightly moisturizer. It doesn’t sting or burn or itch. I don’t feel as if it’s drying out my skin. I haven’t had any breakouts from using it. And I feel as though my skin looks brighter but that could be a placebo effect right now. Ha! We will keep using it. And hopefully by the end of the bottle I will have results. nan
