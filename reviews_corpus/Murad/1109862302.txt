I had a painful acne bump on my chin. I applied this product at night when it was painful, red and swollen. When I woke up in the morning the bump was less red and not as swollen. I applied it again in the morning it eased some of the discomfort I was feeling. I continued using this until the area was flat. It didnâ€™t dry my skin, so I will keep using when I get new pimples. This was gifted by Murad Skincare. It works!
