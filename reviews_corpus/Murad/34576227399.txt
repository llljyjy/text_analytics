Just okay doesn’t seem very effective. I’ve used this daily for 2 months in lower eyes, crows feet, and lids. I haven’t noticed a difference. seems drying and/or tacky for day use. the metal applicator is great in theory but doesn’t blend well. you really have to tug over your skin. if I could return it it would. nan
