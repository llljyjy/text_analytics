I was looking for a new aha/bha cleanser so I bought this one to try it. I was not expecting how much physical exfoliating, which I hate, this cleanser would do to my skin along with the chemical exfoliation. This is too much exfoliating for me. I don’t have sensitive skin, it is used to using stronger actives but this completely made my skin red and itchy after 2 uses. I’ll stick to the Skinfix one since it doesn’t have a physical exfoliating part to it until I can find a better one to try. nan
