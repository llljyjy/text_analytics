I was gifted the Wrinkle Corrector by Murad for reviewing purposes and while I was skeptical, I really like it.In the past I had mixed feeling about Murad products but this one is a keeper for me.  I have fine lines on my forehead and I see immediate results in the look of those fine lines after application - they look smoother and are less noticeable.Granted, these results aren’t permanent but still... It’s a little early to speak about long-term results but I would assume that it works preventatively as well (especially since the serum contains Hyaluronic Acid and Squalane). really reduces the look of fine lines
