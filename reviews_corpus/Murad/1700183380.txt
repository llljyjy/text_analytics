Gifted by Murad Skincare. This acne treatment is gentle (no stinging, redness, etc.) and I like that it can be used morning and night. It doesn’t leave a noticeable residue and doesn’t have a smell. It doesn’t seem to do much for cystic pimples and won’t shrink breakouts overnight though. If you have sensitive skin, I think this might work well for you. Decent for sensitive skin
