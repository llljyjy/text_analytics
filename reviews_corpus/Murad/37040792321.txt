I absolutely LOVE using this sunscreen. Not only does it blend in super nicely, but it doesn’t make me break out. That’s my number one concern with sunscreens these days. I also do not notice a white sheen or flash back with this SPF. I have noticed that a few times with other sunscreens and sometimes the flash back even comes through under foundation.  I don’t have that problem with this one at all!! 11/10 recommend. Finally found an AMAZING SPF to add to my routine
