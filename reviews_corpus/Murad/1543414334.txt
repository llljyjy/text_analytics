I was using the Mario Badescu drying lotion for over 5 years and I started to notice that it wasn’t as effective as it once was. I was excited to try this one out. This one is more lightweight and feels like a serum and not a paste. I like applying it with a q-tip on my breakouts. I like that it’s gentle and effective. Overall I’m happy with the product and It’s a great replacement to the drying lotion. (Gifted by Murad Skincare) nan
