Murad gifted me their Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45. This serum appears milky but it is actually thin and more like an oil. I have dry skin so this isn’t a problem for me and I found it to be hydrating. It does take a little time to absorb in, but I don’t usually wear makeup so this hasn’t been an issue in my routine and I don’t know how it works under makeup. When I first got into skincare it was all about spf and I still feel it is important to use daily regardless of the time of year so having a serum with spf included is an added bonus as I layer it on. a bit oily, but ok for my dry skin
