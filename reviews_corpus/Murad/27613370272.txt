Easily became my favorite sunscreen that I’ve tried so far. Leaves absolutely no white cast and is a great mineral sunscreen, the first one I’ve ever used to actually dry clear on my skin tone! Also love the correcting properties, already seeing a difference with my dark spots after a couple weeks! Great mineral sunscreen for darker skin tones!
