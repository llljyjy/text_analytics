Okay first, the texture is a very light watery serum that absorbs well into my dry skin after toner. Slight floral scent but doesn’t linger. The bottle feels sturdy and is hygienic with a pump applicator. You also get 30ml which lasts a while with one pump a night but idk if I can justify the price. This is one of the few retinols that doesn’t irritate my skin when using it everyday in the pm. Upon application, my skin feels supple and the fine lines on my forehead seem less noticeable and my skin is still hydrated when I wake up. I haven’t broken out or experienced peeling either. The results aren’t drastic since I’ve only been using this for over a week but I do see a slight difference in skin tone evenness and minimizing fine lines (not getting rid of them just yet). Hope this helps! (Received product in exchange for a review) great but you need to be consistent
