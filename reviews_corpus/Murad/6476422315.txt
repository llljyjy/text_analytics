I love these eye patches. First, the size is bigger than a lot of brands which I really liked. They stayed put for me. I also noticed some pretty immediate short-term effects after wearing them once, although time will tell if those effects last. My eye area seemed less puffy and definitely appeared smoother. I also found them really gentle, no irritation like I was worried about initially given the ingredients. So, all around, a new fave of mine!Gifted by the brand. Immediate effects
