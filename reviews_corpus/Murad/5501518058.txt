Eye patches are nice, cool, and hydrating. They are perfect for getting ready for the day and putting on makeup for the under eyes. Eye patches are a decent size, and more forgiving than normal eye patch shape. The single use packaging kind of upsets me as we should try to be less wasteful as a brand but I understand it is to keep moisture and easy to pack for travel. nan
