WOW wow wow, these are good!! I couldn’t use retinol products for almost 2 years because of pregnancy and nursing, and my under eyes paid the price for it. These patches are helping smooth out my wrinkles and brighten up that under eye area. The application has a learning curve with all the different films to peel off, but it’s worth the patience.
