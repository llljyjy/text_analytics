Okay this is just one of those wow products for me truly.  I never have truly tried out a retinol before and this would be my first. I know I am to put a pea sized amount on my face and massage it in. Usually can be used with other serums (no ahas or bhas though ofcourse!) and a good moisturizer ofcourse. I have sensitive combo skin and I was curious how this would be for me.  Doing as I have seen I used a pea size amount every single day during the night and never felt weird irritations or the need to wash my face off. What I did notice was the difference this amazing retinol was making on my skins texture. I could clearly see just how smooth my skin was becoming and how much more radiant it looked. I also took notice on how some fine lines are starting to fade in little by little and acne scars are starting to lighten. I think I can also say this has helped tremendously with even a current breakout I have. No new pimples have appeared and the bumps I had are starting to become invisible or less. Again such a wow product I will use up till the very end! What a difference!
