I’ve been a fan of murad for a long time. I usually get their moisturizers. This retinol serum is a new treat. Usually retinol serums are a bit watery and not so hydrating. This serum has such a pleasant texture. My face isn’t screaming for hydration. It’s definitely a one stop product. It also smells really nice. nan
