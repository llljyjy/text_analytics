I only received one set of patches to try so I can’t speak to it’s overall effectiveness but I can tell you about using them and what I thought.First, you should note that these are sandwiched together with a mesh on the outsides and another sheet of mesh between them. You should separate them first, removing the mesh between them, then applying, then removing the outside mesh from each mask. I got it a little backwards, removing all of the mesh and I think they would have been easier to place if I had done it correctly.These eye masks are huuuge, which I wasn’t expecting, but really liked. I could completely cover my crow’s feet as well as my undereyes. Love!!!After using, my undereyes felt very moisturized and plump but I didn’t see the wrinkle/line reduction shown in the photos. It may be that mine are too deep to get that kind of result with the one application, but my dry skin loved the mosture.I’m a fan of Murad having used lots of their products and seen good results. I think I would recommend these just on the basis of the extreme moisturization, which is fantastic for the undereye area anyway. Very moisturizing for dry undereyes
