This serum feels wonderful and hydrating. It has a thicker consistency but yet so lightweight at the same time.. absorbs right into the skin, no sticky feeling. I have rosacea and this doesn’t bother me at all. I’ll be excited to see how my skin looks/feels over time with this product. Sometimes retinols bother me, but not this one! Yay!!! Rosacea friendly and amazing feel on the skin
