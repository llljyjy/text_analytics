This was gifted by Murad. So for a treatment that’s $44 I was expecting a really amazing quick spot treatment. It’s okay. I was having a lot of breakouts when I got this to review so I was able to give it a fair shot. The small breakouts I had this worked well on but the larger ones it really didn’t seem to make a difference. Which is strange because that’s what this is for. I didn’t like the container - I don’t use q tips so getting the product out was a bit messy and I feel like would be easy to contaminate the product, I will continue to use it as I had to review this quickly. I’f I change my mind I will update my review It’s okay
