I have slight crows feet developing, mild wrinkles on my forehead and combo skin, and have been using this on my wrinkles in my daytime and nighttime skincare routines for the past two weeks. My skin gets so bouncy after application, with no irritation, it glides on nicely with the cool metal applicator. Iâ€™ve noticed my find lines are already smoothing out! Miracle in a tiny green bottle! nan
