I have combination skin and I have been using this product for about seven days now… And I really love it! I’ve never used a product like this before. 2 in 1… A sunscreen that goes on like a serum. Is easy to use with the dropper, and alittle goes along way! It absorbs nicely in my skin and layers perfectly with my make up! Definitely a keeper! nan
