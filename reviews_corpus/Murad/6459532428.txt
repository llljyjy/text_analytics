I love these patches. I wear them for a while at night before I go to bed and they have helped soften the skin around my eyes and help reduce puffiness. I like them better than putting on moisturizer. I have tried wear them all night, but they end up coming off in bed. They start off being slippery and then as they dry, they stick to the under eye really well. I have added these to my nighty routine. nan
