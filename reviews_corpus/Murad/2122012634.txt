I have been getting into using more eye masks as I get older. The Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Mask is a new favorite in my collection. It’s non-irritating on my sensitive skin & under eye area. I have noticed an improvement on my skin texture and it’s help to brighten my under eyes. Looking forward to using it more often to see more results (states to only use 2-3 x per week). So far it’s been working for me and I definitely recommend trying these eye masks! Moisturizing eye masks perfection!
