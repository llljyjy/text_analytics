I loved this SPF gifted by Murad so much! First I absolutely love that it is a serum, it makes it not heavy with my other skincare. There is a very slight white cast but it only lasts for like 10 seconds while you are rubbing it in. I did find it took a little time to set so I just use some setting powder so that I could apply my moisturizer quickly. I spend an hour outside every day at my job and this SPF definitely kept me protected! Also there is zero fragrance Really great SPF!
