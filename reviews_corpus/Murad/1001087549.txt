I love Murad products and these eye masks were so so for me. Mine came in stuck together with the protective papers, so you have to peel the multiple pieces apart to get both masks. I felt like the eye masks were pretty large, the covered quite a bit of surface area. If you leave them on larger than 15 minutes they dry on the skin. I like to keep mine in the fridge for an extra cooling effect. nan
