I love everything from this brand i have tried many products and they never disappoint me and i was so excited to try this spf 45 that i have been using for a few days and i have to say that I love how soft and hydrated it leaves my skin, I also love the light texture it has and how well it absorbs into the skin, it does not leave white marks or a greasy feeling I definitely recommend it I have combination skin and it worked very well for me! Works amazing
