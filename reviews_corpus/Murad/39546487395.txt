I would use the retinol eye mask again! I like that I didn’t’ even feel the eye masks under my eyes.  They did not leave a sticky or greasy feeling after.  I didn’t notice immediate results but I could see after a couple weeks of use a person could see some difference to their eyes. I could see adding them to my weekly routine!
