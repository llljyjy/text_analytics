The Deep Relief Acne Treatment with Salicylic Acid was gifted by Murad Skincare. This product works amazingly for pesky breakouts and zaps them. Results are expected to be seen in 3-4 applicants. After testing the product, I noticed that it had healed some breakouts around my chin and cheek area. It also reduced my redness. This treatment works well with my other skincare items but I make sure to not mix it with retinol or benzoyl peroxide. So good for breakouts
