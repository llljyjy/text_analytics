I found the serum to be really lightweight and it absorbs fast. Their was no tacky residue and my skin felt nice after. I love the fact that it has spf and I found that it really worked.  I went in the sun without additional spf and it didn’t have any redness. It’s so nice not to need an additional spf on mild days. Excellent!
