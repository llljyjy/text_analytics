Very interesting product that actually works! It fills out small lines, and as a bonus evens out such skin imperfections as post acne scars or texture unevenness. Once it dries, it leave a smooth matte finish. At the same time, my skin feels soft and hydrated. The only thing is that I think this cream gives more of an instant effect rather than an improvement that build over time. nan
