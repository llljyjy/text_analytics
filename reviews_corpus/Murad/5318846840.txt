This acne treatment is wonderful! I received this complimentary from Murad Skincare in exchange for my honest review. Iâ€™ve been dealing cystic acne that has beenextremely painful and takes so long to clear up but using this treatment has helped speed up the healing process. Just be sure you use it consistently 2-3 times a day. The product is very water/gel-like  and its very gentle on the skin. It almost has like a cooling sensation on the skin even. What normally takes a week to start healing, I start seeing results in just 2-3 days with consistent use. Love this product! Love the results!
