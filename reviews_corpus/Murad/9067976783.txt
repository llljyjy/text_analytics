I’ve been using this for about 5 months and as someone with temperamental combination skin, this has been a godsend. Most of my skin routine is budget friendly, but this is the one thing I splurge on. It’s hydrating and mattifying and seriously did so well protecting my skin over the harsh prairie summer.

I do my morning skin routine, wait for my moisturizer to be fully absorbed, then apply this, and I find it lasts the day.  The price point is a bit of a drawback, but you definitely get what you pay for. If you have the cash, do it
