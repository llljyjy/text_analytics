This product is working well for the uncharacteristic breakouts Iâ€™ve been getting recently! I do sort of wish the packaging was different, since I use a q-tip to apply this (not sure what better way there is), and that seems a bit wasteful. This was gifted complimentary from Murad Skincare but opinions are my own. nan
