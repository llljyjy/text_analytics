I love that the bottle, applicator, and consistency is more like a serum - it makes me feel like I’m just lathering on another serum during my morning routine and not a sticky sunscreen.  I barely had to reapply, the smell is not strong at all, and I didn’t break out from it so definitely a 10/10! 1 use & already know I'm going to purchase another
