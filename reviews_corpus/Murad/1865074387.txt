I love serums & I recently started using this Murad retinol serum. I usually donâ€™t try to many skincare products with retinol because I find they be too aggressive on my skin, but this one was not the case. It was very gentle on my skin. It gave me such a luminous look, evened out my skin tone, I also felt a much firmer skin. Not aggressive
