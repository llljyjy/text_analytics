I received this product complimentary  from Murad It’s the only treatment that had worked for me and made me more comfortable with my skin. It’s not that good looking but what you see now is scars. All I have now in pimples is 4 small ones on my cheek and they clear fast and dry up. I had really painful and cystic pimples sometimes in clusters which were very painful to the touch. Now with Murad  I never get those and all I need to take care of is my scars. I am on my 1st week and I would like to see the results by week 12. I really hope this review helps you. Only one that’s worked
