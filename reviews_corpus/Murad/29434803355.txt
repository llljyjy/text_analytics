I have very fair skin and am very pale so I’ve always scared from acne really badly. Also have dark under eyes. After about a week of using this every day in the morning I’ve noticed a much more even texture and old and new acne scars look much better. My skin also just has a nicer glow to to it. I also love the creamy light texture of this product. It goes on nicely, feels great on the skin and I don’t need to use a lot of it. Highly recommend. Love it!
