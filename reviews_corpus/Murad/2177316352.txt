This was such a disappointment. I love everything about their City Skin SPF except for how shiny, greasy and sticky it stays on my skin. I was hoping this would be a thinner version of that one with a better finish.Somehow this one is way worse. It has all the bad characteristics of the other version but with non of its redeeming qualities. First of all, this one has no tint and leaves an obvious white cast. It completely emphasized my patches of dry skin and made it look 10x worse than it did before I had applied anything. The consistency is nothing like a serum and is extremely oily feeling and looking. No dry down whatsoever. The applicator sucks. The dropper barely picks anything up, most of the product I got on my face was from the outside of the tube. You’re also paying the exact same crazy high price as for the City Skin but there’s 20ml less of product… Despite this being so greasy, it didn’t offer any kind of moisturizing benefit either. This product has nothing going for it in my opinion and I’ll be returning it. Id recommend trying this on before buying if possible. Immediate no
