I bought this because of the rave reviews, but I very much dislike it (and the price!). I do not get a “satiny smooth“ finish, but a complete sticky, oily mess. It does not dry down at all, and there’s no way I could wear makeup over it. I wish I knew how the other reviewers are able to get a nice finish. The only thing I can come up with is that people aren’t applying the proper amount. Definitely going back. Oil slick!
