I have recently been using the Targeted Wrinkle Corrector from Murad. In particular, I’ve been using it for the lines between the area above my eyes. After using for a week, there does seem to be a subtle improvement where the lines aren’t as obvious. The applicator is nice and the texture is a lovely, velvety cream. Will definitely continue to use daily! nan
