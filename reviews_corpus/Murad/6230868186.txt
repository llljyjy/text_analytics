This acne treatment is a life saver! I have always struggled with acne prone skin and this helps relieve some of the redness, irritation, and inflammation from my bigger acne spots. I used this for 3 days straight and saw an immediate difference in my breakouts. But be careful because it can possibly dry your skin, so make sure you moisturize! This was gifted to me and I would definitely recommend this treatment Staple in my skincare routine
