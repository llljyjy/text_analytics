Salicylic acid is one of those ingredients that’s a must if you have oily skin. Within a week I saw a huge difference in the pimple and the texture of my skin… and I was with using it two days a week. I do wish that the packaging included a dropper to have more control over the product. But I really like it. -*Gifted by Murad nan
