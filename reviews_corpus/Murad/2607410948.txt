I absolutely love this serum! Hands down the best retinol serum I’ve ever tried. The consistency is so lovely and it doesn’t tingle on my skin. Very minimal scent, lightweight cream texture, and just the right level of retinol for my combo and sensitive skin. I use this at night and every morning I wake up, my skin still feels hydrated, plump and soft. I would def recommend this product to anyone who’s still hesitating on buying or not. YOU NEED THIS fr! Best retinol serum ever!
