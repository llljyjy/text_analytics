This product is incredible!! My hyperpigmentation from acne has decreased to a 95%. Definitely recommend if you are struggling with dark spots post acne. I tried Niacinamide and it did not do much for my skin, but with this product I could see the results since the first use. The only issue I had with it was that after using it for 6 months it has a different texture, but works perfectly. nan
