I have always been a fan of retinoids. However, it has taken me a long time to find the ones that do not leave my skin sensitized. This lovely retinol serum is gentle and effective. I did not go through any purging as using retinoids is a regular part of my routine. Make this part of your night ritual and you will be pleasantly surprised by the outcome! Love this serum
