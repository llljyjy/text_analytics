This product is perfect to go under makeup! it’s very light and not too oily or thick. My makeup glides right on after and feels comfortable on my skin. I have acne prone skin and haven’t noticed it made it any worse. I would say it is pricy for the amount but it is good. Would’ve been more worth it around 35-40 price point. Great under makeup
