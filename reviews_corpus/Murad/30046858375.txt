This is a perfect. I am a big fan of Muradâ€™s products . This is no exception. The retinol is quite strong btw; you have not used retinol before , I would suggest first get your skin ready with small doses . My skin looks visibly supple after use. Follow with sunscreen in the AM daily and moisturizer at night Love this serum
