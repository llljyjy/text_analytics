Amazing formula. Not greasy, goes on like a cream and acts as a nice primer if you leave it for a few minuets. NOT DRYING, I found that all of the Elta MD ones dried me out, this has not irritated my extremely sensitive skin and has kept me protected. Almost didn’t try this because of the tint, as most tints I find are really dark on me, this tint is a little pink but does not actually offer coverage. For reference I am a little lighter than the lightest NARS shade. Elegant formula, summary is yes it’s pricey, but if you’ve been struggling like me to find a fragrance free high protection mineral SPF that’s not tinted so dark it’s in wearable, the formula make it worth it. Beautiful Formula
