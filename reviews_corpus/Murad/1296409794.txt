These retinol eye patches are very refreshing. They were pretty straightforward to use create it I laid back on my bed and relaxed. They stayed in place the whole time, no sliding. I only use this a few times so I didnâ€™t see any reduction in wrinkles or anything but they were refreshing and I feel like it helped my skin look better. Very refreshing
