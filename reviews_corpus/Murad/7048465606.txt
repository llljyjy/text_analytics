The immediate mattifying and blurring effect of this product is so satisfying. The consistency feels like a dry jelly (or if youâ€™ve tried the Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen, it has that similar consistency), which leaves your face feeling moisturized and not sticky or tacky. I also like that this can be worn under sunscreen. I look forward to using this product long term! nan
