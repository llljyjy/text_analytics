I’ve struggled with back acne since I was a pre teen and I’ve occasionally bought this product when my acne got pretty bad. This stuff is pretty pricy but the bottle is a decent size and it works wonders. I use this after i get out the shower, dry myself and spray it on my back. Next day it shrinks my back acne so well. I definitely would recommend to use it for a week to see ultimate results. It does dry your skin out though so use sparingly and mostly on the acne spots. Great product. Great Product
