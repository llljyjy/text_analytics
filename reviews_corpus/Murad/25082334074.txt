I have liked all the Murad skincare products that I’ve tried so far, and this one is no exception. The applicator is beautifully designed - the metal messaging side really works well to push the products into the fine lines. The texture of the product is very lightweight and absorbs very easily. It doesn’t break me out or cause any irritations on my skin. I like how it instantly reduces the appearance of fine lines as well as working slowly to improve the wrinkles and smooth skin texture. nan
