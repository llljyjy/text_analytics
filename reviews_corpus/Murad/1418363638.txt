The Murad Target Wrinkle Corrector works sooo well — I have spent a lot of money on wrinkle treatments and this really works. I am using it on a specific area and already seeing results! Would highly recommend if you have targeted areas you are trying to work on. Plus, it is really gentle and doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Works great for fine lines!
