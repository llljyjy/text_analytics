I received this complimentary from Murad. This is the best Retinol Youth Renewal Serum for my skin tone. I love that it targets and treats my wrinkles. This is a night serum and I only use a small amount to my face. I had something like this before but this one is way better. It is a faster acting Retinol serum then what I was use to using. I already notice better looking skin and smoother in just one week of trying this. I feel like my skin tone is smooth after I use my last step of my routine. This product will be in my life from now on. I hope to place an order when I run low. This definitely is an anti-aging product to use it you donâ€™t have a sensitive skin. My skin was dry to start and uneven but not anymore. Love my results
