I got this complimentary from Murad in exchange for my honest review. This is a broad spectrum (protects from both UVA and UVB) mineral sunscreen with SPF 45. Usually mineral sunscreens leave a white cast on me but this one didn’t leave any white cast whatsoever (for reference I am a brown gal.) The texture is very lightweight and absorbs quickly with a sheer finish - not too shiny. It is a beautiful sunscreen serum that also has ingredients (like niacinamide, vitamin c etc) to help fade hyperpigmentation and dark spots so you could potentially condense your morning routine and avoid a separate serum addressing hyperpigmentation. I haven’t used it long enough to comment on that specific claim but based on the inci list I feel like it will probably deliver on it.The only thing I would want different is that I wish it came in a pump instead of a dropper because I just feel they are easier to use. That’s just my personal preference. Good Serum SPF
