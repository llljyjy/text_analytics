I am always trying new sunscreens on the market but this one is SO Hydrating for my dry dehydrated skin. I have found my new go-to mineral sunscreen!!! It does feel heavy when applying but quickly absorbs into the skin for a glowy protected base under makeup. Giving 4 stars due to the heaviness of the product! Hydrating Glowy Base
