This serum sunscreen is lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin without feeling sticky. It doesn’t leave a white cast and hasn’t caused any irritation so far. The only downside is that it’s expensive. Other than that, it’s good product, and I would recommend it. Gifted by Murad Skincare. I like it
