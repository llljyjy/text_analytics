I received these Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Masks complimentary from Murad to try and review. These eye masks are super saturated with essence, unlike other eye masks Iâ€™ve tried.  I was able to use the extra essence on the rest of my face for a little pick me up. The eye masks are big enough to fit from my nose, all the way to my hairline so no part of my under eye area gets missed. This left my under eye area feeling super hydrated and refreshed. They are easy to use and will be a a nice addition to my skincare routine. Very soothing and hydrating
