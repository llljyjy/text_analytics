Wow!  This is one superb exfoliating facial.  I have used it for 5 months now, 2-3 times per week and my skin is much clearer and softer.  I had deeply imbedded white heads above one of my eyebrows and now, the pores are clear!  Black heads on sides of my nose - gone! So happy with this product.  Once I wash it off, my face feels so soft, smooth and clean.  I’ve had oily skin all of my life and this stuff balances it out.  Good ingredients and wonderful scent.  Yes, it is pricey, but let me tell you that it is so worth it.  You don’t need to use too much - about 2 lengths of what you would put on your toothbrush.  That’s it.  It does last a long time.  I just finished the tube I bought on July 2nd.  If you were wondering whether to buy this, yes, buy it.  You won’t be sorry.  Say hello to beautifully clear, smooth skin! This is devine! A must-have in your beauty routine
