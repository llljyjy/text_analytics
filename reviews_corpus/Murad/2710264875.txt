Having this on hand is critical for me! Though I don’t have acne on a regular basis, I’ll get the occasional pimple under the skin. I spot treat with this at night to cure the blemish and without fail, it’s better by morning! I normally only need to reapply 1-2 times before the blemish is entirely gone. gifted by Murad Skincare A MUST to keep on hand!
