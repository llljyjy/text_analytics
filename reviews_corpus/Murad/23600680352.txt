This is one of the best eye masks I have ever used, but sooooooo expensive. They are also a great shape and cover the entire undereye area as well as the crow’s feet area! BYE BYE undereye bags and skin feels wayyyy more hydrated and much smoother.  The instructions say to use this a couple of times a week but at almost $10 a pair, that’s crazy, this would be way better if we could buy 30 pairs in a recyclable tub. However, save the essence in the pack to put on your eyes after the mask! SO GOOD BUT EXPENSIVE
