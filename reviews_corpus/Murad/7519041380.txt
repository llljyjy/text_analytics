Complimentary from murad in exchange for my honest review. This product is great because itâ€™s a serum and spf all in one. After a week I can already notice a huge difference in radiance and brightness in my skin. I love how hydrating it is and how fast it absorbs, as well as the high spf to help protect my skin for the future. 10/10! nan
