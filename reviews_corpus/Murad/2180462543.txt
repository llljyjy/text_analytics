love using murad products and I really enjoyed using this SPF serum. I think it’s very innovative and interesting product. It has nice milky texture with good body that kind of look like SPF cream but absorbs really well into skin like a serum. Only thing I wish was different is SPF 45min part. To me it’s too frequent, specially when I’m out. So I have been using it on the days when I stay home Love the texture!
