I have tried this a few times so far and I will admit that it does instantly plump the wrinkle/line once you apply it. There is a bit of a tingly sensation to the skin for a few minutes after you apply it but its worth it when you see how well the wrinkle corrector worked. Good for those times when you want instant results. instant great results
