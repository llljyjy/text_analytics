Because I hate the feel of most sunscreens once applied I tend to prefer a sunscreen serum and the Murad Correct & Protect Broad Spectrum SPF 45 ha become a welcome addition to my daily routine. It has a really unique consistency that sinks into the skin and layers beautifully with my other products and makeup applies smoothly without pilling. Itâ€™s quite hydrating which is great for my dehydrated skin but I could see oilier skin types skipping their moisturizer altogether when using this. The dropper is really useful because it allows you to dispense the perfect dose and a little goes a loooong way with this one. Love the idea of the UV-Responsive Carotenoid Technology and overall very happy with the level of protection combined with the dewy, radiant finish I get when using this product. Highly recommended!
