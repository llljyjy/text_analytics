While I Iove the glass packaging and the cute tiny bottle aesthetic, it’s not the greatest for applying. I either use a q-tip or like dump a little in my hands but I feel like I’m wasting product. It smells similar to a different brand’s acne serum. Overall the product did work and it helped with my smaller bumps that were under the skin but it didn’t help the bigger under the skin pimples as much. I was gifted by Murad Skincare. It’s ok.
