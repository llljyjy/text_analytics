I have to give it to Dr. Murad. While a lot of the other skincare brands focus on the hippest packaging and chemical exfoliants that will rip your face off, this brand just sticks to helpful products that work effectively over time. This is no exception to the rule! I literally roll the application over any lines and then flip it to the stainless steel side to soothingly press the product in. It doesn’t burn or hurt. My skin feels hydrated by the Squalene and my wrinkles almost completely disappear. I am hooked! It’s Botox without needles. Botox Without Needles
