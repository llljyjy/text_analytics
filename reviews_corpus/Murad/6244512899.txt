I had many expectations from this sunscreen, alas, this is a soaring dissappointment. When you first apply it, it feels good but when you start to blend it and maybe apply some more, it starts pilling. Forget reapplication, the first application is a fail. For the price, this sunscreen is terrible. It is all silicone. Pills pills pills
