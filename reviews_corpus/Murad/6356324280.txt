I am 22 and recently started using retinol every few days in my skin care routine. This formula is pretty strong so I recommend using it once and waiting for five days as your skin gets used to it. You may see some peeling or redness from the product but after your skin adjusts the results are amazing! Retinol can be scary to use to start to start light! I love murad products and this one is great! Donâ€™t skip out on price when it comes to retinol bc the product is so hard to perfect! Love this retinol!
