I can really only speak to the application experience, I’ve been trying it for two weeks, which is not long enough for this product to have a visible effect on wrinkles. I will say the the product and applicator are lovely to use - the serum is a perfect creamy gel texture that soaks in after a few minutes, and the applicator smooths and cools the area. A little goes a long way, and it’s easy to target a specific area. nan
