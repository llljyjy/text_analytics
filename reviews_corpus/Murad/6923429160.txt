I recently received the Deep Relief Acne Treatment gifted by Murad Skincare and so far I love this product! My skin is sensitive-dry, I like that this didn’t irate my sensitive skin. I’m used to salicylic acid usually being too irritating or drying on my skin but this was effective enough to minimize my breakouts while not drying me out more A must try
