I love this cleanser, one of my favorite things is that it is ph balancing. I have issues with bacterial breakouts sometimes and this has helped me with that so much. It is very hydrating and leaves my skin looking clean, hydrated and refreshed. It is unscented which is great for sensitive skin and its gentle to not leave your skin feeling tight or looking dull. After using my skin always looks and feels refreshed and most importantly nice and clean. The bottle is a nice weight, glass bottle and contains alot of cleanser. A little certainly goes a long way. I think overall this is a great cleanser and Iâ€™m so happy to continue to see the benefits the longer I use it! nan
