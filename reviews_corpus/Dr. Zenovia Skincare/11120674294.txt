I am loving the results. I am not old but not young either and the lines are becoming more noticeable as I age. I want to combat this before its too late. This product applies easily and it does take some time for results, but worth it in the end. It does kind of have a makeup tint to it, but it won’t look like you’re wearing makeup. It leaves the skin hydrated and refreshed and is slowly taking care of the appearance of my wrinkles. nan
