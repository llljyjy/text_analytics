I am 56 and have always had great skin but as I get older I needed a product to keep up with my changing skin needs. Bakuchiol  Hydrating Cleanser from Dr. Zenobia skincare is that product!I love the slim can it comes in and ease of use. But as you can see, after using it for a month my skin is more hydrated and glowing then ever. I love that is for my skin type and not a generic store brand. It REALLY WORKS.I work in a drugstore and I see people buying the overpriced creams and gels that just donâ€™t work!!!This does work and This is my new go to for skincare.It not only hydrates skin, helps relief wrinkles but also removes makeup! What more can you ask for? Great Stuff!
