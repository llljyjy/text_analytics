I love this brand, but do keep in mind, it’s a pricey investment. I usually use the CeraVe moisturizer and wanted something even lighter that would better treat my acne. I usually only get hormonal acne, specifically around my chin. I haven’t had a breakout since using this, so it’s hard to tell if it’s preventing breakouts or not, but it definitely helps smooth and hydrate my skin. I really enjoy it and will keep using it. nan
