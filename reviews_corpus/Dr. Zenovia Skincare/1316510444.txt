I was worried that this would make my roscea worse but when I used it, it was so gentle.  I used as directed and still use it every day.  It doesn’t smell bad and it’s light on the face.  My face had that clean feeling you get when your face is truely clean and yet it was hydrated too.  I will continue to purchase this item. Better than I expected
