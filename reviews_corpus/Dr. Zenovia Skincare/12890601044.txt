I received a free sample of Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer in exchange for an honest review. I was blown away by this moisturizer.  I have to stress how good this moisturizer felt on my face. It is hands down the best feeling moisturizer I have ever had. I gave it 3 stars out of 4 because of the cost. Also, the fact that after I stopped using it I had a major break out that I think is due to the moisturizer being hormonal. All in all I recommend this moisturizer. Almost the greatest moisturizer of all.
