My experience: For reference, I have oily, acne prone skin with some sensitivity & redness. This is a non-scented, retinol treatment that has a unique velvety soft texture that I haven’t encountered before for a skincare product. I apply this to acne scars, active breakouts, & especially to necklace lines & uneven textured areas. I’ve been using this for at least 4 months & now that I’m almost finished with it I can happily report reduction in active breakouts & smoothing/evening of acne scars & other uneven textured areas. My necklace lines have reduced in appearance, appear lighter & smoother. I have not experienced any irritation or sensitivity despite having skin that is sensitive. Im incredibly happy with my results so far & plan to repurchase upon finishing my current tube.Overall: This is a highly effective retinol repair treatment from Dr. Zenovia. It has reduced active breakouts, smoothed/evened out both uneven textured skin & acne scars as well as tackled the appearance necklace lines without irritating my sensitive skin. Effective for acne reduction & smoothing texture
