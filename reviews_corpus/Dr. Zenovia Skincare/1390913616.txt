This moisturizer is very nourishing and moisturizing, but not greasy nor sticky.  A little goes a long way and it goes on smoothly.  My skin is on the dry side and this moisturizer has peptide, ceramide, and Hyaluronic Acid, so it really packs great ingredients in one bottle for your skin.  My skin felt plumped, hydrated, smooth, and glowing after using for about a week or two.  Highly recommend! nan
