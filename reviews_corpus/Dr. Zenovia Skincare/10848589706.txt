I love every product I’ve tried from Dr. Zenovia Skincare line. This facial cleanser is great! It’s a very smooth, light, and creamy texture, and rinses off well. It definitely helps my dry skin and dry patches on my face as it hydrates very well! I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a clean feel to their face after washing or anyone needing to add moisture to their dry face. Hydrating for sure!
