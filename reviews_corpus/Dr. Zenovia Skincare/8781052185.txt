I was excited to receive this product from PINCHme for an honest review. I suffer from extremely dry skin in the winter. My face constantly has a layer of dry flaky skin during the colder months. This Dr. Zenovia moisturizer has helped my skin tremendously. I am so happy to have found a product that helped my skin feel moisturized and soft. On top of the great results I love the way the product feels and smells. Not a strong scent so itâ€™s perfect for me. No more dry flaky skin!
