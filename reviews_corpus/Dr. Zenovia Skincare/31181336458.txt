I have been using the Dr. Zenovia  Peptide + Ceramide Repair Moisturizer, twice daily,  for about a month and a half.  It is a light cream that absorbs well into the skin. I have found that a little goes a long way!  I still have at least a half of a container left at this time.  I feel my skin looks healthy and feels soft.  One area of my jaw truly looks more lifted and that is so exciting.   I wish it were a little less expensive but I will consider buying if the results continue. nan
