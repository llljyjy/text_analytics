The Dr. Zenovia moisturizer helped my combo skin tremendously.  I have dry patches around my eyes and mouth.  Nothing seems to really help during the harshest part of winter.  This moisturizer goes on smooth and absorbs well.  I didnâ€™t notice any plumping but I definitely noticed my dry flaky skin was calmed and smooth.  The smell was the only thing that took a bit to get used to.  It smells like gardenias maybe?  Or some sort of flower.  That was a little strong at first but the performance of the product made up for the scent. Definitely helps with dry skin!
