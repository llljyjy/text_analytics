Now that I’ve found this moisturizer I won’t use anything else! I absolutely love all of Dr. Zenovia’s products. They completely healed/transformed my skin. I was struggling with pretty bad adult acne/breakouts (I’m 25) and my skin had never been that bad even in my teens. While the products are on the pricier side, they are 100% worth it in my opinion and I’m not one to spend that much on one product especially when I hadn’t tried it before but I’m so glad I did. It has a nice, light, citrusy scent and it wears beautifully under makeup! HOLY GRAIL MOISTURIZER
