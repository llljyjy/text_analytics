I absolutely love this cleanser from Dr. Zenovia. My skin tends to be dry, but this doesn’t strip my skin and leaves it feeling soft even before I apply moisturizer. I’ve never seen a cleanser with Bakuchiol (only serums), but like that it’s an antioxidant and natural retinol. I also appreciate the care that went into the packaging- no plastic, thank goodness! The metal container feels luxe and substantial. This is a great product, and a little goes a long way, which means you’re getting your money’s worth. Gentle & Hydrating
