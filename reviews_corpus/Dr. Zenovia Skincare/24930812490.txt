I really like this moisturizer! My skin was red and upset when I first started using peptide + ceramide repairing moisturizer and after a month, my skin tone is even and nourished. I will say it is a lightweight, so if you have dry skin, I would suggest getting some jojoba oil to add to your skincare routine as well. nan
