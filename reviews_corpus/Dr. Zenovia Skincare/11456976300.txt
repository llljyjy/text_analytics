I got the dr. Zenovia Skincare moisturizer and I didn’t want to love it cause of the price. Well it didn’t work out that way. This product is amazing. It’s not heavy and sinks in the skin quickly and it’s almost like putting oatmeal on my face cause it moisturizes so well. I need this product in my life. I would totally recommend this product. I have dry combo skin and I get acne sometimes with certain product and this did not make myself break out. I love it, will purchase it again I love it
