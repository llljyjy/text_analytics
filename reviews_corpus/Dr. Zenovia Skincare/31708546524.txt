Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer makes my skin look and feel so much smoother, softer, and younger.  My skin feels immediately refreshed when I apply it, and it feels great throughout the day.  The scent is pleasant too, very subtle and soft.  My skin is aging and can sometimes be dry and dull, but this product is helping it to feel and look revived and fresh. My skin feels great!
