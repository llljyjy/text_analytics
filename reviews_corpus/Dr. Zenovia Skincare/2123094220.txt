I’m 54 and just this last yr have started getting ’jowls’ and increased lines around my mouth , I’ve spent my whole life in the sun unfortunately and didn’t think anything could turn around the damage that I’ve done . I used this retinol for a month and I kid you not , my daughter and my mom both saw me the other day and asked what I’d been doing because I looked so rested and they both remarked how my jowls and lines had almost disappeared. I mean , I noticed it myself but thought no way anyone else would .I’m.verrrry happy with the results and will continue using this and recommending it . 1 month miracle !
