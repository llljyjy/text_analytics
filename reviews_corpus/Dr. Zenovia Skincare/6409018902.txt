I used Dr. Zenovia Advanced retinol night repair treatment nightly for 4 weeks. I saw reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, pore size, and overall texture of my skin. The cream has a velvety texture that instantly smooths skin and gives a matte appearance. I contemplated using it during the day since it seemed to control oil well at night. Feels velvety soft on skin.
