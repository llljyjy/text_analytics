I really like the consistency of the cream it blurs my face which I actually like and it reduces the appearance of pores. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and it also has a nice scent. As far as the scar reducing goes I’m on the fence. I did see a slight difference and I have been using it for about a month, but I don’t know if it’s enough difference for the price point. Some of my scars reduced in appearance but some didn’t. Overall I will continue using it and I do like it but it does take time to see results Slight difference
