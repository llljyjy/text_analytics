Dr. Zenovia Skincare Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer is one of the best creams I have used for my dry skin that is showing early signs of aging. The cream has consistency of a cream but t spreads super easy and absorbs easy and prodes instant feeling of hydration and nourishment.  The skin feels smooth and plump immediately after use.  In fact few times I did not even use any foundation and it gave that beautiful glow after use.  Highly recommend this cream. Must Have cream for 50+ ladies
