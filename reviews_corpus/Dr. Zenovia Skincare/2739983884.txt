Excellent product - no smell, gentle on skin, but washes away makeup. Definitely would recommend. However, the bottle dispenser only dispenses the tiniest amount of product at a time and the bottle is made extra heavy in an attempt to show the product is premium. It’s not good for travel as it is a heavy bottle. That said, despite the packaging that wasn’t my favorite, this product itself is very very good and good for sensitive skin. nan
