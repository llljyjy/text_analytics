I have very sensitive skin and I am very wary of almost anything that I put on my face. I tried this product and was pleasantly surprised. I followed the instructions and put a fairly decent amount on. It went on smooth, absorbed quickly and does not have an odor. It doesn’t sting - which is a plus.  I don’t have any trouble spots except the occasional redness and this seems to help even out. No breakouts or reactions. I am pretty loyal to my regular drugstore products so this would be used along with. The price tag seems to be a touch high but the pump makes it so you don’t go overboard. I have paid more for much less. nan
