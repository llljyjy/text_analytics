Wow. I wasn’t expecting to love this moisturizer considering I have very oily skin. Most moisturizers make my skin a shiny oil slick, but this left my skin feeling smooth as a baby’s butt. I used it religiously morning and night after cleansing. A little goes a long way. It absorbs well and doesn’t feel sticky or greasy, just smooth and silky. I absolutely love the scent. It’s very light and fresh and boosted my mood. It reminded me of a spa. As far as reducing fine lines, I did notice a small difference. My fine lines are still there, but my skin was so well hydrated that they were less noticeable. Don’t let the price tag deter you. It’s worth it. This stuff is FANTASTIC, even on my oily skin.
