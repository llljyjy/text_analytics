I’ve been incorporating this cleanser into my evening routine for the past several weeks and so far, I have really enjoyed it! I didn’t find it was enough as a first cleanse to remove all my layers of sunscreen but as a second cleanse, it lathered up nice and was gentle on my skin and rinsed off well. My skin felt soft, refreshed and supple without feeling drying or irritated. The bottle is a nice, sleek and heavy glass container but the pump mechanism needs improvements. The texture of the cleanser has a thick gel consistency and so it’s hard to pump! It does have a slight orange scent and a little goes a long way! Very Nice 2nd Cleanse!
