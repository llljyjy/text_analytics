This Dr. Zenovia 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Acne Spot Treatment is fantastic! It helps to clear up any hormonal flare-ups that should arise. The antioxidant blend helps to nourish and soothe my skin. I don’t think I’ve ever used a spot treatment quite as effective as this one. Overall, I’m very impressed with this product, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a good acne spot treatment. nan
