I received Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer from PinchMe. Let’s start with it was creamy and easy to spread. The smell was very light and pleasant. Now here was my only part that I didn’t like. I did try to use under my make up before primer and it was a little tacky. I tried 2 different primer 15 minutes apart with same result. Pleasant Smell
