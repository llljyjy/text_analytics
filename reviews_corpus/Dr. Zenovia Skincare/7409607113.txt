I’m 41 so at this point I’ve tried a number of products that claim to make a difference and you end up paying all this money just to see nothing in the end. I was skeptical but I gave it a shot anyways but seriously to my surprise I loved it as soon as I tried it. I like how it’s a serum but almost felt like a foundation for my face. My pores looked smaller and it made me feel confident at night just going to bed. I liked how my face looked flawless but all while targeting my fine lines and wrinkles. The kick is it worked right away and doesn’t take months to see the result. I have no point to mislead you at my age but what I can tell you Is I loved this product and would genually purchase it. I definitely recommend this product over and over again!! No lie it works!
