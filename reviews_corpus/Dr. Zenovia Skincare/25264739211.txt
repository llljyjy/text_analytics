Oh wow I was not expecting to love this as much as I do! This is a beautiful moisturizer, it’s thick, gentle, hydrating, but doesn’t feel heavy or sticky on your face. It sinks right in! It’s suitable for day or night time, and it leaves your skin with a nice satin matte finish. I usually use a moisturizer that’s more dewy in finish but I actually really enjoy how my skin looks and feels when I use this. It’s full of good ingredients and ceramides which are so good for your skin barrier. I love this so much, I can’t say enough good things about it. Sensitive skin babes this one’s for you! Great Product!
