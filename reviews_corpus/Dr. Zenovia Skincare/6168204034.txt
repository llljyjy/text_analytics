I noticed after weeks of use that my skin was smoother. My skin also looks less red and more even toned after using this for a while. I like the packaging concept but the top screws off easily. I am not a fan of the scent although I appreciate the ingredient list. Overall, this one is average relative to other products in my opinion. It is worth a try
