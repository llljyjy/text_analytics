I really liked this product, I was a bit scared to try a new retinol specially on my oily skin but Dr. Zenovia’s  Advanced Retinol is great, I was really impressed at how smooth it left my skin feeling and didn’t cause any breakouts or left a stingy feeling. I’m quite happy and I’ll continue using it. great quality.
