Another great product by Dr. Zenovia . This hormonal dermatology peptide + ceramide repairing moisturizer has a soft creamy texture with a citrusy scent to it. Quick to absorb, this moisturizer gives a youthful look by hydrating dry skin and making it look plump. It can be used AM & PM. It’s great for sensitive skin too. It’s clean and free from and harmful chemicals. The packaging is also recyclable. It worked on hydrating my dry skin and plumping it too. An effective moisturizer, it does what it says. nan
