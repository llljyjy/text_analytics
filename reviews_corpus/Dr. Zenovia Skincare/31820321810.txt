Surprised by this product! I have large pores. Not only that I am super lucky to have gained adult acne ;). My face is sensitive and most products will break me out. The Dr. Zenovia Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment did not! It’s fragrance free so no old lady flowery smell. It’s light weight and non greasy feeling. I can’t tell it’s on at night. I have seen my smile crows feet get lighter and my pores look less pronounced. Love this product and will continue to use it forever !! Surprised how much I love this!
