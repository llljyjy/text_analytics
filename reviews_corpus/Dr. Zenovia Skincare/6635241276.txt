I’ve struggled with hormonal acne for a bit and a few weeks ago I noticed it was starting to come back which is when I pulled out this cleanser. Yes it’s a drying and yes it might leave dry patches on your skin but if you pair this with hydrating products this will work. I’d say if you’re sensitive use it every other day because so that your skin can get used it. I’ve been using it for the past two weeks in the morning and at night and it’s really helped keep my hormonal acne from popping up. I have oily/combo skin. I like to pair this with a hyaluronic acid and the Skinfix Barrier+ Skin Barrier Niacinamide Restoring Gel Cream and at night I use a thicker moisturizer to combat the drying. Overall great product but a little pricy. Great Cleanser for hormonal acne
