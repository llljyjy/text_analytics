I have a combination skin type that is on the dryer side. I use this at night after I cleanse and dry my face. I apply this lightly all over my face and neck, make a note, a little goes a long way. The cream is on the oily and thicker side, however, it absorbs so nicely! This does not have a scent that I can smell. I have noticed such a difference in my skin while using this cream. With the Triple Antioxidant Blend in the product, my skin texture feels smoother and my pores look smaller. The Bakuchiol acts as a natural retinol and powerful antioxidant. As the product states, your skin works to repair itself overnight and it truly feels like it does! I genuinely recommend trying this product. You will not be disappointed!
