I really enjoyed using this Inflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment! I have oily skin, but this did not make me break out. It absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky or oily feeling on my skin. It’s unscented too. I haven’t noticed much difference in my pore size or fine lines, but I do think it’s already helped with redness and puffiness. I also feel like it’s a good value because my tube is still at least half full after using it for 3-4 weeks. nan
