First impression of Dr. Zenovia’s Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment is that is goes on smooth and has little scent. I was currently breaking out and in need of a good acne treatment. This product did help minimizing the appearance of pimples and shrinking in size as well as redness. It didn’t do a whole lot as far as preventing breakouts for me. But I am please that it helps minimize them. I will continue to use in hopes that it starts preventing them as well. I haven’t noticed it helping with any acne scars yet but think this will take some time with any product. Would recommend but not sure yet if I’ll continue to purchase. Good Brand
