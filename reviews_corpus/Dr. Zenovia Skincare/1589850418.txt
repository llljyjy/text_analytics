Received a sample of the Dr. Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment and so far this product has been good to my skin.  The serum comes with a pump that makes it easy to dispense and hygenic.  It is pricey, but you just need a small amount (even though it recommend to apply a richer/thicker layer) to get a soft, smooth and nourished skin.  As I continually use this product, I am curious to see if it will repair uneven texture and diminish my wrinkles. nan
