This took some time for me to like. I have dry skin and I am used to thicker, heartier creams. This is a very liquidity gel cream formula. I was surprised how hydrating this was. My skin seems to drink it right up. I found that it layered well on top of my morning serums and under my SPF and makeup which is great. I ended up enjoying this but I do think it would be too thin for the harsh winter months. nan
