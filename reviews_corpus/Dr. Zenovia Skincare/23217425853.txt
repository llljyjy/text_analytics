This seems like a very high quality product but I’m not sure it’s for me.  The bottle is nice and heavy, but the product is a little awkward to dispense.  I really like that a little of this goes a long way, you only need one pump, and there is a nice, light scent.  It disperses easily over the skin, seems to cleanse well and rinses cleanly.  That being said, I didn’t notice the hydration promised by this cleanser, my skin feels drier and more in need of moisturizer now than it did before I started using this.  I would recommend this product to those with oilier skin or perhaps for use in the summer time. nan
