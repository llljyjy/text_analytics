I have been liking the Dr Zenovia skincare products. This serum is to reduce the appearance of acne and scarring. It’s gentle and absorbs in the skin right away. I use it in the evening. Only thing is the smell is not that great but it’s not too strong and goes away shortly after applying. I will keep using it. Nice serum
