I have used this product consistently for approximately a month every evening and have noticed a slight improvement on a fresh scar on my leg. The texture is quite thick and it definitely leaves the area where I apply it feeling moisturized and protected. I had no adverse reactions and did not notice any smell or tingling. nan
