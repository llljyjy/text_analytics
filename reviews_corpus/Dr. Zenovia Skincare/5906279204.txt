I have combo skin but since it’s cold and dry out this moisturizer does the job. I’ve been using this for about 3 weeks seems ok I only use it at night because I need a moisturizer with spf for the day. When I wake up I don’t seem to have excessive oily skin like other moisturizers I’ve tried. just ok
