My combination to dry skin is prone to hormonal breakouts and it is difficult to find skincare products that will treat acne and blemishes without drying out and stripping the skin. This cleanser though is gentle enough for the skin but deep cleans my skin without leaving my skin feeling tight and dry afterwards. I only need a small amount of the cleanser and massage it onto my wet skin in circular motions. It has a light fresh clean scent. This cleanser is very gentle yet effective in calming down and hydrating my dry and irritated skin while it removes environmental pollutants, excess oil and makeup. My skin feels smooth, soft and hydrated without any dryness or tightness. This is the perfect cleanser for soothing and calming down my irritated skin and for keeping my skin clean and clear!
