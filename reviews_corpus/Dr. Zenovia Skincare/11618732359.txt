This moisturizer smells amazing and makes my face feel so soft and smooth after it has dried. Fortunately, a little goes a LONG way. I will say it almost feels more gel like when you try to rub it into your skin, but if you just massage it around evenly then allow it to dry, it feels amazing. I would love to buy more of this in the future, but the price is so high.. I will have to continue using the product I have to see if I really believe it’s doing it’s intended job. Smells great! Little goes a long way!
