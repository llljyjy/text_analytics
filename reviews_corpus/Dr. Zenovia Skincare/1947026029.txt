i am obsessed with this formula! i have been using it consistently for about 3 weeks now and it is absolutely great. i have gotten a lot more into skincare in my 30s and this has to be one of my staple night time routine items. the serum does not have any harsh fragrances and it is super light weight. it absorbs into my skin right after applying with minimal wait time and has the most beautiful gel like consistency. i have not noticed any pore size reduction but every morning i wake up with beautiful nicely hydrated plump skin and i love it. hopefully over time i see the other benefits like a reduction in fine lines, pore size and dark circles. night time routine staple
