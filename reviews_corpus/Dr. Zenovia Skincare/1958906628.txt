I have very sensitive skin and tried the Dr. Zenovia Skincare Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser. Normally face cleansers leave my skin so dry but this one did not and left my skin very hydrated and smooth. It was very gentle on my skin and left no redness at all. Highly recommend especially for those with sensitive skin. Dr. Zenovia hydrating cleansers
