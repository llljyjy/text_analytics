I received a decent deluxe sample of this product a while back, maybe in the summer. I recall using this with lighter moisturizers and it pilled. Fast forward to now, I just pulled it out my stockpile. I’ve been using this in my pm routine under SkniFix moisturizer. I gotta say, these 2 products work beautifully together. All this to say, not sure if I’d repurchase due to cost.  However, if you received that promotion it’s worth using. Ok
