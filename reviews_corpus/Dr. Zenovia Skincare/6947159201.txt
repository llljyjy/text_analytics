I still struggle with breakouts the week before my period starts. I found using the products in this system when I know the breakouts are on the way works really well. I have sensitive skin so I donâ€™t know if I could tolerate long term use, but using it every other day for one week a month has no adverse effects on my skin. Great for hormonal acne
