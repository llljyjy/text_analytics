I really like how this has been treating my skin. I use it as a serum and apply it my skin after toner and before moisturizer over the past few weeks. It feels non sticky, and has a nice creamy texture that’s easy to apply into my face. It absorbs quick and well, which is always a pro for a serum. I’ve started seeing less pores on my skin after a week or so, so I feel like it’s definitely working for me. nan
