The smell is great, texture is too. It isn’t the best pump to get the product onto a sponge or cloth. The bottle is really nice though. I think it’s possible this dried my skin out a bit. Could have also been seasons changing so I’m not certain of this. I was given this item as a free sample to try. It was ok.
