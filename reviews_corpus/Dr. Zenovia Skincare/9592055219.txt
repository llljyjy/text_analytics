I am happy with this advanced retinol night repair treatment. The overall appearance and texture of my skin is very smooth and soft and clear. Love using this after steaming my face in the shower at night. I canâ€™t really comment on how it helps with wrinkles as I am under 30 years old. But I could definitely see and improvement in my overall skin texture and appearance. Works for sensitive skin!
