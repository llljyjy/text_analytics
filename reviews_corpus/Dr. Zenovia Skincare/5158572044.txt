Works great. It smells good and dry your skin out. It’s a nice fresh kinda clean. My only concern is that it’s in a glass bottle. I had to sit it on my shower floor since I was worried about it accidentally breaking. The pump could extend out a little more too. Change the bottle and I would rate this 5 stars. nan
