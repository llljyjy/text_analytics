I used this on a freshly new scar I got from a big pimple. From the first time I used it, I noticed reduction starting from the outer edge of my scar. As I have continued to use it, I have noticed that the scar diminishes more in size and is less pigmented. I have also been using this on older pimple scars but have not  found as immediate results. Iâ€™ll keep using it on them since the results are slower based on how old the scar is. nan
