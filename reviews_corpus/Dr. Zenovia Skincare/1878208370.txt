This would probably be closer to a 3.5 rating, but I decided to round up. I love the actual cleanser. I think it’s super effective at cleansing my skin without stripping it. It has a light smell to it, it’s not overwhelming. My skin can be sensitive, but this has not caused any reactions.  I do not love the heavy bottle though. I can just picture dropping it on my foot, ouch. I also do not like the pump, for me it doesn’t consistently work (a little comes out or a lot comes out, or nothing). I would definitely prefer a squeeze bottle. Good product, don’t love the packaging
