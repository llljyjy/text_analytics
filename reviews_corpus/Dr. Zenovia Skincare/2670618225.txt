This is the second product I tried from Dr. Zenovia Skincare. The first product did not work so well on my skin so I am hesitate to try this one. I think I should not judge too soon until I tried it as I like this Retinol Night Repair creme a lot! It has a very creamy buttery texture. It makes my skin feel so smooth and soft after applying the creme. I have combination skin type and it did not irratate my skin. Iâ€™ve been using it for more than 3 weeks and notice a slight difference. Hope to get a even better result after finishing this tube! nan
