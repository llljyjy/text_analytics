Unfortunately this product didnâ€™t work for me. It stripped my face of all oils causing it to get dehydrated and flakey, and also caused more breakouts. I also noticed that the towel I use to dry the face after washing got discolored after using this cleanser, even though I washed the product off thoroughly with water. Too harsh and bleaches clothes
