I’ve been using this Dr. Zenovia Peptide and Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer for several weeks now and I am in love. I have extremely dry skin and it’s perfect for both my day and nighttime skincare routines. It’s been doing wonders to hydrate my skin and leaves it feeling so soft and supple. It’s even working on my fine lines. Definitely should give it a try! Love it!
