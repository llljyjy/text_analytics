Great Starter product. This anti-aging serum is super gentle and scentless. It absorbs well and does not feel tacky or pill. I think results are minimal, but it feels nice on the skin and is a good product for anyone, especially in their 20s who is looking to get into anti-aging without harsher retinol products. nan
