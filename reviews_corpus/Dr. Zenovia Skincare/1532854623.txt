I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I love it! I have noticed a difference in my skin. My face looks brighter and more youthful. I feel like my skin is looking more even and my pores are not as noticeable. My skin feels smoother, and ny dark circles have also gotten better. I think with longer use I will see even better results. I really like how the product feels when putting it on and how it soaks into the skin. For me it did not leave my face felling oily or dry. My overall experience with this product has been great! I would totally recommend this product. LOVE
