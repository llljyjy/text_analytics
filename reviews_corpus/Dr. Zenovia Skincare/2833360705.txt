I have been enjoying Dr. Zenovia peptide + ceramide repairing moisturizer for about 3 weeks. I love that it is not sticky and absorbs into my skin with not much effort. It is hydrating but I do use it at least twice daily morning & night sometimes in the afternoon as well. What I do not like is the scent however it is a light scent & doesnâ€™t last long. I also wish it was a pump & not open jar container. nan
