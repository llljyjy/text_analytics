I received the Dr. Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment free from PINCHme for review. This product is awesome! It goes on very smoothly and blurs the skin like a primer would. In the time I have been using it, I have seen noticable results. My skin looks more even and better overall. I recommend this wonderful product! nan
