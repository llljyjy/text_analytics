This cleanser is really great for my sensitive skin. The key ingredient evens skin tone and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles dark spots and pores. It has become one of my favorite cleansers to use a few times a week. The price point works for the size and quality of the product. Great for Sensitive Skin
