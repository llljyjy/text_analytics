This is the first time I’ve used a product with Bakuchiol. I’ve been wanting to try it out since I’ve heard it’s more gentle than Retinol with the same results. I really liked how this product worked on my skin. I saw a decrease in hyperpigmentation and redness after the first use. My complexion was also brighter and more clear. This product contains Resveratrol, Vitamin E, Green Tea and Bakuchiol. It also has Genistein, which is supposed to help hormonal imbalances skin. It’s a beige color and very light upon application. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave the skin oily. Highly recommend for any skin type, especially those with gentle skin. Awesome stuff!
