This cleanser is wonderful! I switch to a foaming one targeted at acne when I need to, and then I switch back to this one for the gentle care that it gives my skin! It doesn’t foam up, but I find that it does a great job of removing my makeup, as well as cleansing my skin. I don’t feel tight or dehydrated after using it. I typically use 2 pumps, so I feel like it’s going to last a long time. No detectable scent. Pampering for my skin
