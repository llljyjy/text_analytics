I received Dr Zenovia peptide and ceramide repairing moisturizer and used this for about 4-6 weeks. I’m impressed with the results! My complexion became much clearer. And the texture of my skin became much smoother! My dark spots lightened slightly however my fine lines and wrinkles definitely softened. My pores we’re unchanged. This product had like a milky consistency, however absorbed quickly with no sticky residue. My skin was felt so much softer!! There was no scent so this would be a good moisturizer for any type of skin concerns even sensitive skin. I know I have combination skin and my skin hasn’t been more oily at the end of the day. I recommend this product to family and friends because I definitely see a difference.andnthis product works!! Will be buying this again!
