I’ve been using this moisturizer for about a month now and have seen an improvement to my skin. I’m 50, so I’m dealing with dry skin in some areas and combination skin in other areas on my face. This has helped my dry patches without making other areas oily or having breakouts. My skin looks smoother and feels more hydrated longer throughout the day. I use it at night because I use an SPF moisturizer during the day. By the way, the SPF moisturizer I use is the same that I’ve used for a long time and the only difference to account for my increased hydration and better looking skin is the Dr. Zenovia skin care moisturizer.
