I love how this feels on my skin! It feels like a primer more than a treatment cream. It’s so smooth, doesn’t have any weird scents and makes my skin feel great. I haven’t  noticed a major difference in my wrinkles so it’s hard to tell if it’s working. I will continue using it because of how glowy it makes my skin though! Feels amazing!
