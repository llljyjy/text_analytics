I would like to preface by saying I got this product for free. The packaging of this product & the texture of the actual product is nice. It didn’t irritate my skin but I honestly also just feel it didn’t really make that much of a difference especially for the price. I do think it’s hydrating though & maybe I just need to use it longer. nan
