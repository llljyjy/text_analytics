This is a very smooth buttery cream that absorbs so nicely into my face and neck.  I have been using this nightly for almost a month now and I just love how clear, soft and even toned my skin looks.  No irritation, no redness, and no breakouts.  This is an absolutely amazing retinol repair treatment that works great in my skin. Gentle and Effective Retinol treatment
