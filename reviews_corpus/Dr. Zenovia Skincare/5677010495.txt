Received complimentary for review. This cleanser does the job at cleaning my face and taking off my eye makeup after 2 washes. There is an herbal like smell that is pretty mild and doesnâ€™t stay on my face after rinsing away the product. The cleanser did not break out my skin and left my skin feeling hydrated. I love the simple look and it comes in a glass bottle. I would recommend. nan
