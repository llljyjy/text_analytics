This scar gel is incredible. At first I was a bit on the skeptical side as having been disappointed in the past with other scar healing products. But this Dr. Zenovia Scar Gel Treatment works so well. I have only been using it for a few weeks and am already starting to see a difference in the scarring on my face. The product is a bit thick but once rubbed in, it soaks into the skin quickly. I canâ€™t wait to see how my face will look a month from now. I really do love Dr. Zenovia products I have yet to be let down by any of them I have used in the past. Works incredibly well!
