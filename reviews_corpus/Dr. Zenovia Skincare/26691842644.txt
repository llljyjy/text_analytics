Im excited to use this cleanser coz I heard a lot of good things about it.. On the first time using it, I immediately wash it of coz it feels like burning my cheeks and it makes my cheeks red.. It doest feel like a sting but it really feels like burning.. next day I tried to use the cleanser again and again it feels burning again.. The next day I decided to skip it, the next day again I tried to use it again and my whole face feels burning.. I decided to stop using this cleanser.. My whole face kinda feels like raw for 1 week and I can’t use and I didn’t apply anything on my face that time coz it hurts that much even moisturizer.. It didn’t work for me but it doesn’t mean this will not work for you too.. It’s  just this is not for me.. Not for me!
