This is a very good facial cleanser. Very light weight and leaves no residue behind nor does it strip your face. I do 4 light pumps and use on my face in a circular motion. My face is left feeling clean and moisturized which works for me because my skin easily strips. Definitely would recommend!!! Just wish the price was lower. Great moisturizing cleanser
