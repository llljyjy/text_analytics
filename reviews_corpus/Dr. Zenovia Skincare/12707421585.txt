I personally used this on acne scars and scarring due to a bad facial picking habit and I absolutely noticed a difference! It took about a week or two before I noticed any difference but that’s about the same time frame as any other product. I lent the bottle to my mother who has a larger scar from a cervical spinal fusion (4 years ago) and she said over time she’s noticed a little bit of a difference. Mind you, that’s an extremely extensive scar so any noticeable difference, even small, is awesome for her!! Actually worked!
