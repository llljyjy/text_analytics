Dr. Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment has been a treat to my skin, with a positive experience when I wake up. Having combo skin I appreciate that this overnight cream isn’t too heavy. I started using this over a week now and I noticed an improvement in my skin’s texture, feels smoother and I haven’t noticed any new acne. The formula is a light yellowish color and it goes on incredibly smooth, leaving my skin feeling super soft. It has a faint scent, can’t pinpoint what it is, but only noticeable when looking for it. I really hope this improves the appearance of my acne scars the longer I use it. Wake up to super Smooth & Hydrated Skin!
