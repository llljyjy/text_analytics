Although I had big hopes for this line because my skin is so hard to work with I didn’t care for the smell of it and it didn’t seem to help with my breakouts. It did dry my skin out in the places I used it. So this particular product from the line was not my favorite. I have combination skin and maskne so was hoping this would work I also have Hyperplasia which this does not work on. nan
