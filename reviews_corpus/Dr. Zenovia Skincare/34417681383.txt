Honestly, I was surprised by how much I liked this! It feels great going on and absorbs fairly quickly. I’m pretty young, so I don’t struggle with fine lines or wrinkles, but I feel like this made my skin tone brighter and more even. I can’t really say if this reduced my pore size, but it definitely hydrated and refreshed my skin. Would recommend! Good
