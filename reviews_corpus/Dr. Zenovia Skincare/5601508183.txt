I tried out this after I got done using the entire Dr. Zenovia Skincare system. I LOVED the skincare system and saw a huge improvement in my skin health. I wasnt as impressed with the Bakuchiol Hydrating Cleanser. I thought it cleaned my face alright, it smelled good I just think I was so far impressed with the system that this just didnt impress me as much. Good Product, The skincare system is much better
