So far this night repair treatment has been nice and calming. I love the consistency of the product. The look of the bottle is appealing. I feel like when I apply this product, it really absorbs into the skin and gets to work. It’s nice knowing that overnight my skin is getting some TLC. Its soothing and easy to apply. I like that it’s a new take on overnight treatments. I’m curious to give it more time to see some results. I will continue to use and update my review after about a month or so. Thank you to Dr. Zenovia for sending me this full size product via #PINCHme to use in exchange for my honest review! Overnight comfort
