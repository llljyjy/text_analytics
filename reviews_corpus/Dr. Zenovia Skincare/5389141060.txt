The Peptide and Ceramide repairing moisturizers is light and hydrating. I am looking for a moisturizer that I can use both day and night- one that won’t interact with my Retinol(pm) or Vitamin C(AM). I am glad that none of the ingredients in this moisturizer will effect my other serums in my skincare routine. So far it has been hydrating, but I haven’t used it long enough to see results in fine lines and dark circles. It hasn’t irritated my skin so thats a plus! Hydrating and Gentle
