Iâ€™ve been using Dr  Zenobia skincare Scar Gel Treatment for a couple of months, I applied it to a scar on my neck from surgery over 5 years ago, I think it faded just a little, BUT I applied it to a line on my forehead ( wrinkle) and amazing faded and faded, I LOVED IT.The gel feels nice on the skin and only a small portion is enough. I love it
