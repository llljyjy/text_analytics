I was excited for this when i read the reviews so i bought this and the moisturizer because both sounded great. The first time i used this the pump was so hard to get out i almost freaked out it took about 2 days of pumping to finally get it out and it was so minor. Next i realized after a couple days my skin was getting very very dry and my skins already super sensitive i stopped using it for awhile, then today i used it again and the same thing it dried out my skin and it feels itchy. The moisturizer is amazing game changer i mean i love it but the face was i really wish i never bought it. Very Drying!
