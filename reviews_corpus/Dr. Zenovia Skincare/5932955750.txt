I Loved my free sample of Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer. I have been using the product for 2 plus weeks and can really see the difference in my skin. I love the scent, texture and creaminess. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling softer, more plump and supple. It works great on the dry patches on my face right now during cold weather and evens out my skin tone. Iâ€™m very happy with this product! nan
