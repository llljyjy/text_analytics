I received the Dr. Zenova Peptide & Ceramide Repairing Moisturizer to try out.  I was happy to try it and received the full sized pot (not a sample). As a 62 year old woman with dry/combination skin I need a rich moisturizer in the Winter especially.  I love the ingredients in this product and how they benefit the skin!  Peptides, ceramides and hyaluronic acid all three in this one product is a hit with me! A Hit with me!
