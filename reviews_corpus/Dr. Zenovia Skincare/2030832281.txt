Dr. Zenovia Peptide + Ceramide repairing moisturizer is very effective! I really like this moisturizer and as someone with dry and sometimes flakey skin, finding a moisturizer that actually works is very important. The smell is amazing and I like the texture of this moisturizer - it’s thick but absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy or tacky residue. As someone who struggles with hormone issues, this is something that I never knew a moisturizer could help with - I will be continuing to use this moisturizer daily! I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Very moisturizing and smells GREAT!
