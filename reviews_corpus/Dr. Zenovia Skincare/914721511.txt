As a woman in my early 40’s, the signs of aging are becoming more evident and the need for better quality ingredients is super important. However I also don’t want to have a cabinet full of products. I love that this cleanser has retinol, vitamins A, C, E, and antioxidants all in one product. This cleanser is extremely hydrating and leaves my skin refreshed and smooth. nan
