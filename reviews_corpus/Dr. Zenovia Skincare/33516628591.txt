The only thing that has kept my hormonal acne under control. It is a bit drying but I don’t mind that. What was on my chin constantly has disappeared completely. Still working on my forehead acne but even that has significantly decreased. When I do get a pimple it goes away super fast. You’ll see results after about a month! Been using since 10/2021. Overall it works! nan
