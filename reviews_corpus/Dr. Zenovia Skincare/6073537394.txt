While I was exited to try Dr. Zenovia Scar Gel Treatment, at the same time I was nervous of the results because of my past experiences with other scar treatments. I noticed on the first week of using Dr. Zenovia Scar Gel treatment, the skin looked more soft and hydrated. This gel is thick but not greasy and it also feels sticky while applying it, but once you spread it around the affected area the gel doesn’t feel thick anymore. It doesn’t have any scent and absorbs quickly. This gel is a blend of reg-ulate360 complex, silicone, bromelain and papain enzymes. I’m amazed at how many things this gel can treat, like scarring by acne, cuts, surgery, burns, insect bites and high friction areas. I’m so glad I found this scar gel treatment before my next surgery. Definitely an excellent product! Excellent product!
