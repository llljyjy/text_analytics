Applies smooth and is easy to use. I have some acne scars on my cheek area and I think it helped minimize them a bit. Didn’t affect the makeup applied over top which is good. I haven’t tried it on older scars but I also have one that I got recently on my arm and it does seem to have helped smooth it out so far. I would repurchase this if I had a scar that I absolutely wanted to minimize or smooth out because it is pricier. Good for newer scars
