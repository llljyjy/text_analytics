I have been using the DR. ZENOVIA PEPTIDE + CERAMIDE REPAIRING MOISTURIZER for a few weeks and I have noticed a big difference. My skin is sensitive, not really oily or dry. My face felt and looked more moisturized than before. I use it in the morning before I start my day. It isn’t heavy on my face like other creams. I like that there isn’t a strong scent. My face looks brighter and more hydrated. I would highly recommend and already have! Looking fresh
