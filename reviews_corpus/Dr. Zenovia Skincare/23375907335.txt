I had no idea that a face cleanser could make my face look this good. I had pretty dark circles under my eyes and my skin was really dull too. This brought my skin back to life. And even though its a little on the pricey side, you only have to use a little bit, especially if you have a silicone face tool. After this I dont think I could go back to my old cleanser. Wow..... New holy grail.
