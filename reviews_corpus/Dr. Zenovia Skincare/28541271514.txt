This hydrating cleanser has worked really nicely on my face these past 4 days.  I like that the bottle is thick glass.  The pump on this bottle only pumps out a small amount of cleanser at a time.  Which is ok I donâ€™t mind.  When I put this on my face I felt a nice cold sensation.  It really made my skin feel really fresh and soft.  I also love the way it smells.  It has a light orange scent.  I look forward to using this product every day. I love this cleanser!
