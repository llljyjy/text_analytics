I tried Dr. Zenovia skincare - Peptide + cermide repairing moisturizer. It has a wonderful citrus scent. It feels like a gel or sticky cream. Goes on well and absorbed immediately. I have sensitive skin and there was a slight cooling feel, but it goes away quickly. Reduced small wrinkles and moisturized my face without feeling oily. I enjoyed this product! Nice moisturizer
