First off this packaging is great, a tube with a pump!  The formula has a very light weight feel to it, and it feels smooth.  This doesn’t really have a scent to it, which I appreciate.  On me this formula absorbs fast and the surface of my skin feels smooth.  Although I haven’t had a big improvement on my skin, I do feel it’s working its magic.  I do notice the slightest improvement on a scar I have had.  My scarring isn’t from acne, but just from picking at this area on my face that over time created a dark scar.  I’ve been resisting the urge to pick at it so it can look better.  I apply this nightly and I haven’t had any bad skin reactions from using this Dr. Zenovia advanced retinol night repair treatment.  My skin has peeled some from using this, but if that is going to help improve it I don’t care that it does so. Slightest improvement, I have hope!
