When I received the Bakuchiol Hydrating cleanser, I couldn’t wait to use it. When I did, I could not get the bottle to pump. I had to unscrew the top, but still found it very difficult to get out. I do, however, really love the cleanser. It is ver mild and doesn’t smell strong. It made my face feel clean, yet moisturized. I love it! very nice!
