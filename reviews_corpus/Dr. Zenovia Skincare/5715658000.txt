This is a great spot treatment for the price that isn’t too harsh or drying on your skin! A little goes a long way and remember that this is marketed as a spot treatment so avoid putting it all over your face especially if you are prone to dry skin. I always put it on after I clean my face and use toner. I let it sit and dry for a couple of minutes before moving on to serums and moisturizers. Even with my dry skin during the winter time it didn’t show any dry patches. I only use this about 2 times a week, depending if I get random pimples. Good spot treatment
