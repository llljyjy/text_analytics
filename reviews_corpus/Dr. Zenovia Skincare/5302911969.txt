This set is very comparable to other benzoyl peroxide acne products that I have tried in the past such as the Neutrogena Clear Pore and the Panoxyl face wash. But this set doesn’t smell or reek of that typical medicinal benzoyl peroxide scent. It smells very light and didn’t seem that harsh on my skin. I really like using it especially the face wash on my back and armpits, which I hear helps with sweat and odor so you don’t even need deodorant. The face wash is 10% benzoyl peroxide so it might not be that suitable for people to use on their faces unless they have really severe acne but I don’t so I use it on my back and armpits. Would recommend people to use it slowly as not everyone’s skin type is suitable. Comparable to other benzoyl peroxide products!
