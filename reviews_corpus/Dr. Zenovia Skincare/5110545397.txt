I tried this stuff on old scars (4 + years) faithfully 2x a day for about 3 weeks and have seen zero effect, unfortunately. I tried this on a more recent acne scar from the past year and it hasn’t diminished at all either. There wasn’t any unpleasant tingling or side effect so thank goodness. I was hoping for a holy grail product but just did not see anything change at all. It’s really tacky and will make the rest of your makeup oily for the day if you use it on the face. The instructions also don’t say at all if this is specifically for acne scars or any old body scar. No Effect
