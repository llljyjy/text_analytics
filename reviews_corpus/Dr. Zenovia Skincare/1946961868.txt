I actually never thought about using any form of retinol  products until I tried this advanced retinol might repair treatment. I’ve been completely blown away. I use it nightly and it’s been a godsend for both hyperpigmentation and areas with textural differences. I’ve been recommending this product to everyone I know! I thought my skin looked great before but this has most certainly kicked things up a notch Game Changer!!
