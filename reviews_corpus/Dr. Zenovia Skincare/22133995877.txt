The Dr Zenovia Skincare scar gel treatment is a nice feeling and thick gel. It absorbs easily into the skin after rubbing it in for a bit and doesn’t feel that sticky. It does not have a noticeable effect over short term use but I think it’ll work better if you apply twice a day for a longer period of time. I only used at night because make up didn’t sit very well over it. I received this product free in exchange for an honest review. Scar gel only used at night
