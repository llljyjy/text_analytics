I work at a dermatology office as a medical provider and have access to a lot of peels. The fact that I really like this product says something. It’s a great product for those who want to improve texture, pore size and overall skin tone. If you want to save extra money you can even cut each or the pads in half for twice the quantity especially if you have a petite face. I use these daily at nighttime after washing my face, then put my retinol on top of it. I wake up with fresh glowing skin. I’m also very acne prone and this has helped to control a lot I’m not 100% clear but a lot less congestion in my pores than I had. I also have sensitive skin so sometimes I find these sting a tiny bit but it goes away really fast and it’s still worth it. the best toner pads!
