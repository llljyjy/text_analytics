I have been using the Dr. Zenovia peptide and ceramide repairing moisturizer we’re almost a month now. It has a nice texture, and no scent, which I appreciate. The package says to use it twice a day, but I’ve only been using it at night because I tend to forget in the morning. Skin care often takes a while to see results, but I do think that my skin looked a little better than usual last week. I went to work two days without wearing my usual foundation. nan
