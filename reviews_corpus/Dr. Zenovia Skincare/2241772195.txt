I love this cleanser, but....the packaging is awful!  The first bottle I had, the pump barely worked, but I repurchase anyway.  The second bottle, the pump doesn’t work at all!  Very frustrating and unfortunately I will not be repurchasing.  It’s a shame, because the product itself is really nice. Nice product, bad packaging.
