This is my favorite cleanser I’ve ever used. My skin looks a lot healthier and brighter since I started using it. It’s gentle on my skin but still takes care of dirt and oil. It doesn’t take a whole lot of cleanser to wash my face, so it lasts a long time. My only complaints are the bottle and pump aren’t a great design, but everything still works, and it’s pretty pricey. nan
