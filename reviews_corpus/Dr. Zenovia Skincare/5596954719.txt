The Dr. Zenovia Skincare Scar Gel Treatment works well with recent and old scars of mine. I use this gel on my acne scars and burn scars to help reduce the look and redness of the skin. The gel doesn’t have much of a scent and the texture is thick which I use a thin layer every day. I use this typically before I go to sleep so that I won’t be touching it or messing with it. I do notice a difference after a month of use. I notice less redness/discoloration which is what I want to achieve. I’m very happy with the results. nan
