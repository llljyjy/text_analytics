I love this product!! I have very oily and sensitive skin and sometimes it’s acne prone. I find his product very helpful on the days that I have acne and I also have acne scars on my forehead and I’ll be applying it and I see a small difference. However  I can’t  expect something big because this is very old scar ...when I was 6 years old but this definitely going to work a lot better for acne scars. The formula of this product is great it’s not too heavy or sticky is drying really fast . You can apply to your skincare routine without being concerned if it’s going to have any interactions it’s totally safe!! Very helpful for acne and acne scars
