My skin feels amazing after using this for two weeks! My skin is smoother and softer than before. My only dislike, is that it feels like a skin primer when applying. Feels heavy, but by morning, the heaviness is gone and Iâ€™m left with soft, supple skin, AND my few little breakouts have disappeared! Love this product! Great results!
