After trying Dr. Zenovia SkincareInflam-Aging Night Repair Treatment I would have to say that it did not give me the results I was looking for. The product felt nice on my skin. Skin felt soft after application without  leaving an oily or greasy feeling however I did not notice my pores becoming smaller or my skin looking more even after using it. nan
