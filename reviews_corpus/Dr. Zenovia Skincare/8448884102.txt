I have been using this for almost a month every other night. I find the texture on my face feels velvety. There is no scent which is a good thing for me in this product. The squeezy tube for this product with a pump seems to work well and dispenses just enough every time.When I first started using it, I broke out a bit, but for me with these kinds of creams is normal. Once that stopped oh my word my skin looks so plump and feels so soft and my lines are not as noticeable, as well as the redness has really gone down. I think that once I finish this bottle I may purchase another. I really like using this every other night as it is tolerated well. Overall, a great product that I really enjoy using! Really Lovely
