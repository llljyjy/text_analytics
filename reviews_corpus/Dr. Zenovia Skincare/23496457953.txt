I have used this product nightly and have noticed it has slightly helped to fade some acne scars I have on my face. It also helps me to look not so tired when I wake up in the morning. My skin looks fresh and alert. When I first tried to use the product it looked like it had separated a bit, so I recommend priming the pump or gently shaking it a bit. After the first couple of uses it has been fine. I like the pump packaging and the texture of the product itself. It leaves my skin feeling very matte and it does not pill or leave any residue. It was gentle enough on my skin and I did not experience any sensitivity or irritation. nan
