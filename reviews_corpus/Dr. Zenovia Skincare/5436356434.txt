I personally hadn’t heard of this brand, so it wouldn’t have been one I’d have thought to purchase. I was fortunate enough to try this for free provided I gave an honest review. After a few weeks of trialing the product, I’m very happy with it, and most importantly so is my skin! I’ve got PCOS so it does a lot of crazy hormonal things to my skin. With this, it seemed to help keep things in check! Even during that time of the month. Amazed? Absolutely! For me, this is a gem that I’m keeping in my products most definitely!! Very very happy with everything about it! (texture, feel of skin post application, scent etc). Yes def a winner for me! This is staying in my routine!!
