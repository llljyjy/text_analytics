So I tried this peptide + ceramics repairing moisturizer and got mixed results. Went on smooth and I liked the texture,it was great for skin suppleness. My skin felt moisturized and hydrated. But it caused clogged pores leading to blackheads on the nose and crease between bottom lip and chin. Will definitely use because I liked the other results but just on cheeks, forehead, and neck. nan
