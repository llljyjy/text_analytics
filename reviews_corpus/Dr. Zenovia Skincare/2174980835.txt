I been using my Dr.  Zenovia Advanced Retinol Night Repair Treatment for few weeks and I do notice a good change on my skin.  I like the texture of the product just like a primer and how it melts on my skin without leaving a greasy feeling.  My skin feels soft and my overall skin texture is improving. I noticed that is also helping with my forehead fine lines.  I highly recommended to everyone looking for good retinol that will not irritate your skin. Great Product!
