I will never be without this moisturizer again. I’ve had hormonal acne for over 20 years and nothing has ever calmed and hydrated my skin like this stuff. It isn’t active like BP or AHA but it complements either sooo well. Most oil-free moisturizers barely do the job and moisturizers that contain oil make my skin worse. Where has this been all my life?My breakouts are less severe and my sensitive skin actually tolerates actives now. Also a huge bonus is that it all but eliminated rosacea.I truly love this stuff. best of the best
