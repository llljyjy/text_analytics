I have really liked using this advanced retinol night repair treatment from Dr. Zenovia skincare. I use it as a serum which I think its how its supposed to be, so pre moisturizer.. I was slacking on my night time routine and getting this product really helped me stay on track because I was liking the feeling of using it. It is light and absorbs well. I have not used the full tube/pump yet but I do feel some improvement in my skin tone/texture and also the fine lines. My skin feels supple. I also have vey sensitive facial skin but this still works and did not burn/sting or make me feel uneasy.. I do use my own moisturizer - an indie brand. I will recommend this based on my personal experience. Took off the one star because I find the combo of pump and tube weird..only one is required imo but Iâ€™ll know better when I get to end of the tube if this combo actually helps.. Very good serum!
