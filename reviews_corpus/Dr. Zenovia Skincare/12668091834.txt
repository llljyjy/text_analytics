Love the hydration given! I  use it day and night , very moisturizing  leaves the skin feeling soft and calmed. No tackiness or heavy feeling on skin. Just perfect for my Dry skin. a little goes a long way, I  like the fact that is a pump tube,  texture looks runny but it’s a perfect consistency thin layer to absorb unto skin fast . These are the type of skincare products my mature skin loves !As a  DRY RESILIENT creams as such are the best for my skin .After a few days, my pores are less , my fine lines are tighter , meaning less visible. Not gone just less visible and I love that because when I wear makeup they don’t settle in there ! Thanks to this product Add to my skincare routine
