Works so well and has a thick consistency I used it on some old acne scarring and it started to lighten up the scars within a week. I have been using it consistently day and night and I think in another week the scar will be so light you won’t even tell it’s there. You do have to make sure it’s well absorbed but it’s like petroleum jelly consistency. Non clogging. Excellent stuff. nan
