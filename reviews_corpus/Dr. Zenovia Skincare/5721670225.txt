I have rosacea and acne scarring on my cheeks, so I was scared to use this product thinking it might work for scars but make my face burn. The price is high for only 22 mL but ITS WORTH IT. Ever since I started using this about half of my redness is gone. HALF. That’s incredible. I have bought enough rosacea and redness products for me, you and a horse but nothing works. My face hasn’t burned since I started using this product. If it continues to work, I don’t care how much it is. My face doesn’t burn and my skin looks amazing. It’s very hard for me to cover my redness even with full coverage makeup, but today I was almost in tears after putting on foundation for the first time in years my skin is less red I actually looked normal. As for the acne scars I cannot tell yet, I’ll continue to monitor for changes and attempt to update my review. Oh Myyyyy Rosacea
