I LOVE this moisturizer. I struggle with some dry patches in the winter and this healed my skin. I love how this makes my skin hydrated, and plump. I havent seen my skin look this healthy in quite some time, I’m loving the results from this. I do think it’s a bit pricey but honestly I would splurge on this when I run low. Best moisturizer for winter
