I have been using this serum for about a month now, every morning and some nights when I’m not using other actives. I’ve tried other vitamin C products and they have all caused me to breakout but my skin tolerated this serum well. No breakouts and I’ve noticed some mild improvement in dark spots and fine lines. I like the packaging and the dropper makes for easy application. I didn’t give it 5 stars because this product is so pricey I was expecting better results. I will be trying skinceuticals c e ferulic next. It’s worth a try given Sephora’s generous return policy. Worth a shot!
