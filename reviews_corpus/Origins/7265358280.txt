I was kind of confused by this product. It definitely was not a “moisturizer”. It was more of a thin mask you put on for acne under your actual moisturizer before bed. I’m pretty surprised people are claiming it was moisturizing. I do have dry skin though, not oily.  That being said, I didn’t see results either way. It didn’t clear my skin, but it also didn’t break it out or harm it. Maybe I just had the wrong type of acne. Neutral, better products out there
