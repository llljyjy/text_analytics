I am in love with this face wash, It has a clean scent not perfumed and i feel comfortable enough to use it daily. Its a foaming wash that adds to the experience of washing your face gently without worries of micro abrasions. If you have dry skin especially during the winter i definitely recommend giving this a try. The only downside i noticed is the packaging says to keep away from the eye area so if removing makeup you may need to add an extra step to remove eye makeup. Clean and soft!
