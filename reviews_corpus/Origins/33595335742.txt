I normally don’t use lotion as I don’t think it’s necessary but this one I just tried is amazing. It makes my skin very soft and ready for the next step of my skin care routine. It smells musky and unisex. I believe it’s sensitive skin friendly as I didn’t feel any irritation. I will definitely add this to my routine. nan
