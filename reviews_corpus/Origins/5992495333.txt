I was really excited to receive this product as I was looking for something to help reduce the redness of my skin.  I really like that it was a liquidy consistency as it wonâ€™t be so heavy during the summer months. I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. It has definitely helped keep my skin hydrated and plump. Definitely reduced the redness on my face. I would recommend this product to friends and family! great product!
