I have sensitive combo skin, and this has worked wonders to purify and give my skin a healthy glow. It’s not overly drying and doesn’t strip your skin after washing. The scent is a sweet honey, which could be strong if you’re sensitive to scents. The texture is thick and a little goes a long way with this mask. It’s grey with gold specs in color. I definitely recommend this for oily/combo skin  or someone who only needs help decongesting pores and Help clear skin. This mask doesn’t give immediate results or a drastic change for the price point but it’s worth trying if you have large pores or blemishes. nan
