I was looking for a matte moisturizer to use daily under my makeup- sadly the matte moisturizer from sephora collection, which was AMAZING for my skin, is discontinued. I have combination/ oily skin with large pores in my T- zone, as well as some dry patches. This cream is light and absorbs very well. It is not heavy or sticky at all, and does not cause any breakouts. However, it does nothing to prevent or absorb oil, and within an hour or two, my T zone and forehead are super shiny. It is also not very moisturizing, and I am left with stubborn dry patches that cause my foundation to look flakey and uneven. I didn’t find this to be a very good value. I bought the 50mL container and the product doesn’t last very long. In my opinion, clinique moisture surge or laneige water bank are better moisturizers (although neither of those are great for oily skin either). Maybe this product just isn’t for my skin type... Absorbs well, but doesn't help with oil
