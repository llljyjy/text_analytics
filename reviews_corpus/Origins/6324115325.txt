This product came at the perfect time. I’ve been having really intense chin breakouts since having to wear my face mask more often. I have dry skin normally so moisturizer is an every day necessity for me so it was just a bonus that this was an acne treatment and moisturizer all in one. I’ve seen significant improvement in my skin since starting to use this day and night for approximately two weeks now. I feel like my acne heals quicker and my skin is overall smoother and clearer. This moisturizer does have a scent, but it’s actually one I enjoy and doesn’t linger too long after applying. Hydrating & acne-clearing
