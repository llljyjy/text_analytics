I was very surprised by this product. With the name ‘treatment lotion’ I wasn’t expecting this to be more of a toner/essence formulation (not the brands fault, just me not paying attention). I typically feel like products like this are gimmicky, but I really did enjoy the extra punch of hydration from using this, and it did seem to help with some of the redness I occasionally get on my cheeks. nan
