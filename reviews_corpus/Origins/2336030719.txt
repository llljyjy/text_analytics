I’m not sure why I hadn’t tried many origins products in the past, I have only tried a mask from them but I really enjoyed it. I was so excited to be receiving this in a box. To begin with, the packaging is so simple and I feel like it makes it look so pretty because of that. it’s also a plastic bottle which I actually prefer because sometimes I am clumsy and can drop my products. With a plastic bottle, I don’t have to worry about breaking a bottle. There is a lot of product that you get as well. When applying this product, I feel like there is a spa like experience. This stuff smells absolutely amazing. I’m a licensed esthetician, and i dermaplane myself using a professional dermaplaning tool (10 blade scalpel) , and I used this the same day I had dermaplaned, and it didn’t even sting my face. I can’t get over how wonderful this product smells and feels. I love to use it morning and night. I would highly recommend this product. smells like a spa
