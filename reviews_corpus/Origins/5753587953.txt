I have super dark circles under my eyes, that even concealer wonâ€™t fully hide, and wanted something to help lighten them up.  I tried this, and used as the directions stated, morning and night for about a month with no results at all.  My under eye area still looks the exact same, and I find that it even makes my circles stand out more.  When I use just my normal moisturizer, Drunk Elephant, alone, it looks less visible than when I use this, and put my makeup over it.  Definitely not for those of us with super dark eye circles. Did nothing for my dark undereye area
