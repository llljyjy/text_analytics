In the past, I’ve struggled to find skincare products that work for my sensitive skin (I have mild acne & severe rosacea). I was excited & nervous about using this product, because I’ve gotten my skin under control. This product helped with active acne & it doesn’t make my rosacea flare up. So far, I’ve incorporated it into my morning & nighttime routines, I’ve already noticed a positive difference in my skin. It can dry your skin out if you use it with other actives (which has happened to me), but overall, it’s a wonderful product. Rosacea
