WOW! Y’all run, don’t walk when it comes to this moisturizer. It is the perfect gift for friends,Family, or yourself. It’s great for all skin types and makes your skin look and feel it’s absolute best in no time at all. I have been using this moisturizer for two days and I cannot believe the difference in the look and feel of my skin. I’m turning 30 next month, and I’ve been working hard to get my stress acne under control as well as helping keep my skin looking it’s best as I start the aging process. It’s super important in your 20s to keep a skincare regimen so you can help reduce the effects of aging earlier on. I am seeing way less redness, soft supple feel, no texture, and no adverse reactions from my sensitive skin. I am obsessed with how cleanly it applies and doesn’t leave residue. I can easily apply makeup after and not worry about it pilling up on me. Love it!! Great stuff!!!
