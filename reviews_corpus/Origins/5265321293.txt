I was so excited to try the new reformulated GinZing Energizing gel cream! Years ago I had purchased the original and I loved it for my skin. I love that it is a gel/cream combo. It’s not too thick for my oily skin, however it sinks into the skin really quick because of it also being a gel. It still has that original citrus scent that I just love! It puts me in such a good mood when applying. It keeps my skin glowing from within and that is truly my goal at the end of the day. It works beautifully underneath makeup as well due to its consistency and texture. I’m happy to have this moisturizer in my rotating skincare routine. Glowy skin for the win! Glowy skin for the win!!!
