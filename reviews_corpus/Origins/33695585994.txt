I used this cleanser about two years ago, my skin didn’t have any issues then, just a minor pimple every now and then. As far as I remember, it did get rid of it fairly quickly. Most days, my skin felt nice and clean after using it. However other days it felt tight and squeaky. So I can’t give an exact verdict, but it’s definitely something I would love to try again and would even recommend. Personally, there was no issue regarding the scent. nan
