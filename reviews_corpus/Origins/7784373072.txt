This literally did nothing. I didn’t notice anything different, no help with puffiness or dark circles. Spend the extra $10-15 and get a different product. I went for this one since it’s a little more affordable compared to other products. I’m only 23 and don’t have any major needs for an eye cream, a little darkness and puffiness under my eyes. But I would still love something to actually help versus do nothing. Again, maybe try something else I know tatcha, glow recipe, and Kiehls have eye creams with great reviews. Higher price but it’s worth it to actually see results. Try something else this does nothing
