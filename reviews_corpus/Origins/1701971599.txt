My favourite cleanser of all time! I’ve been using it for years and it works really well with my skin and doesn’t break me out. I took a break from using it for about two years because I wanted to try out other cleansers but they weren’t doing anything for me plus I started breaking out and they wouldn’t help with that either, so I went back to this cleanser and can see a big difference in my skin. Only thing I recommend is that when using this cleanser you MUST properly moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry if you don’t! My Fave
