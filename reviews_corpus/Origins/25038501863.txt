When I first tried this product I was surprised at the consistency it is not like your typical lotion and is more liquidy. I put some in my hands and used it on the back of my arms. The back of my arms are always red and bumpy so I used this and 24 hours later they are still soft and hydrated. I am excited to continue using this product as it as has really helped reduce the redness on my arms! Love this for Redness
