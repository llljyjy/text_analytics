I’m obsessed with this stuff. I’m 19 years old and have dark circles that aren’t puffy, but are deepest and this really makes them look so much brighter. I use this everyday with or without makeup and see the biggest difference when I don’t wear it. I love to use this with a cold guasha in the mornings. I’ve gone through maybe 4 of these!! NOT A DAY WITHOUT IT
