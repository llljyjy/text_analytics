I had never used this brand before so I didn’t know what to expect, but this is one of the best face washes I’ve ever tried. It’s creamy, cleans well, is gentle, and keeps my face clear. A little bit goes a long way, which is awesome because I won’t have to buy it as often. I have no complaints about this product. I will buy it again in the future and I highly recommend it to everyone. Perfect
