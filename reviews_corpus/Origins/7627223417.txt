I have only been using this product a couple weeks so canâ€™t speak to long term results but I put this on a clean face then layer with moisturizer and makeup and it layers extremely well (no pilling like some anti aging products). I love the smell and texture of this product as it goes on. I have not broken out at all either which is always a concern having sensitive skin. No complaints
