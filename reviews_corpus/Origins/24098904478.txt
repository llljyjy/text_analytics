I have not been using this very long, but I’ve already noticed improvements to my skin. My pores look smaller and feel cleaned out better than with other products. Also the moisture seems to be restoring when I use this. And this really does plump the skin and brighten, so I can only imagine after a couple months how good my skin will feel and look. The scent is a lavender earthy scent, kind of reminds me of patchouli with a bit of mint but it’s not bad, it’s a natural smell. The consistency is just like a toner, which is watery and sinks into the skin nice while restoring your skins barrier. I will keep using this and see how my skin feels and looks after a little while but first impressions are I love it! The plump is REAL.
