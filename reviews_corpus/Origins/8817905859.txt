I enjoy using this soothing lotion.  It helped tamed the redness I usually get. It felt good on the skin and after using my skin felt soft.  If your not used to applying a liquid it can be easy to waste this product as it comes out fast. I also felt that it helped tame the oiliness on my skin as well.  It had a light scent but isn’t overbearing so I didn’t mind. Overall I liked this product and I will continue to use it. nan
