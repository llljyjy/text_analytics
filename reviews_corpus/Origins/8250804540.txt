I like this lotion. Its much thinner than I was expecting. About the consistency of a toner, but doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry. Hasn’t cleared up my redness immediately but I have noticed a slight difference. I think I’d like a bit more moisture personally but this is a great addition to my current skincare routine!
