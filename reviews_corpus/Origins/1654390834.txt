I received this for free in exchange for a review, so please keep that in mind. I haven’t used this for very long, but here are my initial thoughts: - The formula is very thin and watery, as advertised- It does sink right into the skin- There is a subtle, very natural smell to the product which does not bother me but may not smell great to every nose - It plays well with my other skincare I haven’t been using this long enough to see any long term impacts, but it seems to boost the moisture in my skin. I’ll continue to use this, but I’m not sure whether I would repurchase. Nice so far..
