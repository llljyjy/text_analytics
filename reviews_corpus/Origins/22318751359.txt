I received a free sample of the PLANTSCRIPTION Multi-powered Anti-Aging Peptide Serum and the first thing I noticed is that it is more of a creamy serum as opposed to some of the more jelly like ones. It is super moisturizing but not oily or greasy and sets into your skin very nicely. Iâ€™ve noticed my skin is much more supple, glowing, and has a more youthful appearance. It also brings a little flush of color to my cheeks in all of the right ways. Will definitely need to pick up some more of this serum once I run out! My skin is very dry and it is loving this stuff. nan
