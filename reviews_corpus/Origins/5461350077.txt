This toner is absolutely amazing! It’s incredibly soothing and hydrating. It’s helped tone down my redness while not causing breakouts. The smells is kind of weird, but not unbearable. I received this for free, but I’d definitely rebuy. You get a lot of product and it’s quite nice. I would recommend to my family and friends who want a gentle, yet effective product. nan
