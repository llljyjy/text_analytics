Hands down, the best moisturizer that I have ever used. I have used several moisturizers in the past but this one is great. It goes on very smooth without feeling greasy and it doesn’t leave your skin looking shiny either when you put it on.  I don’t feel like I need foundation when putting it in because it does have a matte finish that holds over time. Also works great under my makeup when I do wear it. I couldn’t stop applying it to my face! From the texture to the scent! It absolutely is some of the best moisturizers I’ve enjoyed using! ! The scent is delicious and it’s not too strong that it’s too much. It’s perfect and so clean looking and feeling. The packaging is simple and refreshing just like the brand and product! My overall appearance after applying is smoother looking and radiant. Hands Down, Absolute Best.
