I love the texture of the lotion, it is highly moisturizing but not heavy and even soothing. I use a variety of brand across US, European and Asian brands, but this is by far one of my favorite lotion. I have a normal skin but tend to get dry partially and seasonally and this lotion helps to hydrate and smooth the skin all year around. It is my forth bottle and will continue to purchase. The price is reasonable for this quality and quantity. Highly recommended. Hydrating and soothing high quality lotion
