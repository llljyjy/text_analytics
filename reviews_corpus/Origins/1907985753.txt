I have oily but dry skin = cystic acne. I’ve tried it all. Cool thing about oily skin is that most of my friends have fine lines and I don’t, however, cystic acne has scarred.I use this in combo with other face washes. I wouldn’t use this everyday, it reminds me of the salicylic acne washes from middle school/high school days.Stripping all oil from your skin is not the answer. I repeat, stripping all oil from your skin is not the answer and will cause more blemishes. Find a wash that washes dirt and oil without your face feeling like a dry chalk board. PCA oily wash - use this daily and mix checks and balances in once or twice a week. PS- Get retinol from a doctor. Stop wasting money on weak retinol online tisk tiskThank me later :* Add in the mix
