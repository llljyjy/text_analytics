This smell is SO strong. To the point where it’s all I can smell even 30min after applying. It sort of smells like nature/dirt, mixed with lemongrass, mixed with mint. It’s a hard scent to describe. I know it’s made with a lot of essential oils so I’m sure it’s a mix of all of them. This being said, I haven’t been using this product like I should. It gives me headaches most times I use it.When I have used it, it did provide a nice moisture to my skin. It’s a really nice texture and provided a nice cool feel to the skin. I’m not too sure on the prevention of new blemishes since I haven’t used it consistently!  Overall if the scent wasn’t strong, I’d be able to use the product(: Strong fragrance
