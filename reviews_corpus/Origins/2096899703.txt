I really liked this mask after I got past the stingy feeling when you first put a new product on - my skin isnâ€™t very sensitive so was shocked that I had such a reaction, but once I stuck through that initial feeling and wore through the mask, my skin looked and felt really clear and tight. Overall really liked it but would only recommend to those who have non-sensitive skin stingy feeling
