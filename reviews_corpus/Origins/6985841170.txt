Used this toner for the last 5 days. It pours out really fast so a cotton pad would work best although I did try with just my fingers also. No complaints although itâ€™s hard to tell if there are any noticeable results with this product. One good thing I liked about this toner is the lack of burning sensation and fragrance. Nice night time soothing toner
