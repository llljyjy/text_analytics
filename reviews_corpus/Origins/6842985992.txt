I have combination skin, and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed getting using the Checks and Balances Frothy Face Wash as part of my daily skin care routine. I use it as my second cleanser in a two-step double cleansing method, where I use this product after an oil-based cleanser. I have really liked the results I am seeing. I know and trust Origins as a brand as well. nan
