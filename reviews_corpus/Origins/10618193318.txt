This is a great moisturizer. It only takes a tiny bit to foam and clean your whole face, so it’s a much better value than expected. I love the smell and how smooth the product feels on my skin. It really feels like a luxury wash. I haven’t had any breakouts since starting use. My only critique is that this one feels more stripping than my CeraVe face wash which I was using previously. I feel like this product would be great for skin that leans more oily. In the summer I think I will like this product even more. For now, I just use a thicker moisturizer and it works well. If you have dry skin, I’m not sure if this would be a good product for you. Love it!
