The Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask is the first Origin brand product I’ve tried. I thought that the mask worked well for a mask and it didn’t dry my skin out too much. I can’t say that I feel it helped clear out any small breakouts I had, but I do feel like it helped make my skin brighter and deep cleaned my skin. The formula was gentle on my skin and didn’t leave it feeling tight. I loved the texture of this mask and the application of the mask was easy. The product easily glided on the skin. One other thing I love about this product and the Origin line was that it was made without a lot of toxic chemicals and add in ingredients. I look forward to repurchasing this product as well trying other Origin products. Clean Beauty Detoxifying Mask
