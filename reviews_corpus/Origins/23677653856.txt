First off, I received the Origins Clear Improvement Moisturizer for free from BzzAgent in exchange for my opinion/review. honestI have used several different types of pore/acne clearing products, but nothing like this. It is truly a nice experience because of the instant cooling sensation as well as the almost minty scent which I assume comes from the type of treatment acid that’s in it.It is very thick for a moisturizer. I noticed if I don’t allow enough time for my serums/oils to absorb or if I use too much then it starts peeling or rolling up into balls on top of my skin. I do enjoy it, and plan to continue using it! Thick, but very nice sensoral experience.
