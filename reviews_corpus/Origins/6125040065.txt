This is my first product from Origins. At first when I read lotion, I didn’t expect it to be liquid. After using for three weeks, I feel the huge difference. I have a very dry and sensitive skin, and can’t use just any product. I love the ingredients of the product. I usually use a cotton ball and than rub my face with it. My skin feels softer and more dewy after using for a few weeks. I recommend trying this product. Impressed
