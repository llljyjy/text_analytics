I’m so excited that I was able to receive a free sample of the Origins PLANTSCRIPTION™ Multi-Powered Youth Serum. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks now. The formula is super light weight and absorbs quickly while leaving a light, natural scent. The first week using, the bottom half of my face was super dry from blowing my nose often and I had experienced a slight burn on the parched skin, but as I hydrated my sensitive skin, I had no other reactions. I’ve definitely noticed softer skin and feel that my skin has a nice glow about it! This is my first serum I’ve really used, so I don’t have much to compare it to, but am impressed so far.Excited to see the results after using the entire bottle! nan
