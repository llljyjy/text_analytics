I received this product complimentary in exchange for an honest review. I usually use a mask once or twice a week and this one has been my go to. At first I got concerned because I felt a slight tingling feeling but after a minute that feeling went away. I felt it one for the recommended time and my face was so soft. After one use I saw a immediate brightness to my skin and softness. I found after using this mask my skin felt and looked super nourish and less congested.However it does smell like honey so if you don’t like that smell I wouldn’t get it. I don’t mind it. Also I would like to add its such a pretty iridescent brown color and I love it! So good!!!
