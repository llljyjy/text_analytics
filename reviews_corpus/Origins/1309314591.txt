This product is marketed as a lotion, but it has the consistency of water. It should be marketed as a serum and packaged in a bottle with a dropper. That being said, the product has a very mild, pleasant scent which I appreciated. However, I didnâ€™t notice and real effects from using this product in terms of radiance or moisture. Not a lotion
