It certainly smells like charcoal, but it’s not bad unless you’re sensitive to fragrances. Since it has Salicylic acid, it helped improve my blemishes. The packaging is super cute and nicely packaged. It’s currently below freezing where I am, so I can’t wear this on its own, I would have to layer a thicker moisturizer if I’m going out into the cold. nan
