I’ve been using this serum daily for the past couple of weeks and I honestly love it. Might be my new favorite. I just love how smooth it goes on and makes my face feel. Absorbs perfectly & doesn’t feel sticky or oily. I also really like the subtle smell of it. It has more of a smell than other serums I’ve used but it was faint. Just felt very natural on my face. Not sure how youthful my skin is looking but I do think I’ve had a bit more of a glow lately. New favorite serum!
