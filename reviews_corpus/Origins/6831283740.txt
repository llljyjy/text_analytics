The Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion has now become my go-to treatment skin sensitivity!!! Last week my skin was very irritated and it was all red and patchy which looks awful. However, after replacing my toner with the treatment lotion, the next day my skin was feeling a lot better. EVEN BETTER is after three days of using the lotion, my skin was back to NORMAL!! The lotion does an amazing job calming the skin and helping it to restore resilience . It also helps strengthen your skin barrier against environmental stressors. It was literally all I needed. This has been a life saver! And I also love the scent too (it has a calming herbal smell to it). Will definitely continue to use it as part of my daily routine and 100% recommend!! nan
