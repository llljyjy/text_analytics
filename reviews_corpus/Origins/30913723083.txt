So to tell you a little about my skin it is very dry and very sensitive. This clear lotion is used as a toner for me at least that’s what I have seen some reviews say they used them for and so I used it for as well. But anyway, it’s my go to toner because it soothes and hydrates my skin for a whole day and do not give me dry patches and redness. It’s actually the opposite it takes some of the redness in my face away and the lotion doesn’t burn. My go to toner!
