I love the Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask the mask helps drawn-out impurities and cleans my pores really well. The mask has a unique appearance which has a grayish-black but with golden metallic-like glitter in the mixture. There is a slight tingling feeling when I first use it but not irritating at all. The mask easily helps make my face smooth and balanced. I feel like my skin is baby smooth after I use it each time. I would recommend this if you want something to help hydrate your skin but also clean out the pores. Softer and Cleaner Skin
