Love the combination of charcoal and honey. I havenâ€™t seen this before in a face mask, and am so happy Origins came up with this! Charcoal is an OG in my skin routine for clearing blemishes and restoring PH. I love the texture, not too much moisture, yet not overly tough. I definitely trust this brand to provide spa quality and safe skincare products. Perfect FaceMask for All Seasons
