Love the smell of this moisturizer. I have found Origins to be a nice moisturizer brand with “bonus“ benefits usually, and this one does give your skin a matte finish instead of that more oily “dewy“ finish that’s been trendy recently. It reminds me a bit of the peach sake serum by Skinfood that was popular for a while, but became more known as a primer.This moisturizer goes on very nicely under makeup, but it’s not the most hydrating moisturizer unfortunately. For the price, I don’t think I would re-purchase unless it was half off. Like a primer
