I love when a face wash can give you a rich lather! It really feels like it is washing away all the oils and impurities from your skin. I have oily skin and this has done a great job of balancing out my complexion. It’s not drying and smells great. I’m really happy with it and look forward to having this in my regular rotation! nan
