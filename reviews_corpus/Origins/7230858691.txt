Why haven’t I found this sooner! I got this yesterday as a sample/reward in the package I got from Sephora. Used it today after my workout and I love it. Amazing cleanser, it’s so gentle, literally is frothy and so smooth, Not rough or a rough texture, it’s white and cleanses so nicely. I squeezed a bit from the product in my hand, applied it onto my dry face then put a lil bit of water on my hand and massaged it. I let it soak a bit, just so it really cleanses and then I rinsed. The best things I think of this cleanser is how it really works with my anxiety, cause I have anxiety of like soap residue and can be rough with my face with that being said but this, no no, cause i don’t see bubbles or anything when rinsing off so that’s such a positive!! Also I love how it’s so gentle, feels amazing, isn’t rough and doesn’t dry out the skin. I absoutely love this!!!! I love this its so gentle & helps with my anxiety
