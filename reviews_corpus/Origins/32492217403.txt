Received this item as a free sample. Origins is my first expensive (compare to those $5 face wash in grocery stores) skin care brand I use. I was introduced by my friend and love it since then. I love the rich form. It’s smooth and gentle. It did help a little bit with reducing my nose and forehead area oil. The most I love is it doesn’t give the fake glossy, smooth skin feeling like a lot of the other ones do. Love it!
