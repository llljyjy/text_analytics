I received Origins: Mega-mushroom relief & resilience soothing treatment lotion a couple of weeks ago. Upon receiving the lotion from Origins, I quickly noticed that the lotion was in liquid form and I started getting skeptical about how it’s supposed to leave my skin moisturized. Upon trying the lotion after cleansing my face, I realized that it’s definitely easier to apply the lotion with a cotton pad than with my hands( which helped retain more of the product). The Origins mega-mushroom relief & resilience soothing treatment lotion has a nice fresh, light scent to it and really feels kind of like water. But leaves a clean refreshing feeling once applied to skin. When I use the lotion my face feels really light but not dry. I like the lotion and have added it to my skincare routine. Just a quick note, if you already have a skincare routine you might experience minor skin purging but it clears up after a few days of continuous use. Clean and refreshing
