I am so glad to have found this moisturizer. It works so well with my skin leaving it refreshed, soft, and rejuvenated. I have combination skin and it works just perfectly without making my skin oily. It has also helped with hyperpigmentation around my chin area. The moisturizer has been amazing at keeping my skin soft and hydrated in the cold winter when some parts on my face gets extremely dry and flaky. So excited to see how it will clear up my skin more with continuous use. A must have for combination skin
