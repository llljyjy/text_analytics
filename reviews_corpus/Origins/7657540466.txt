I’ve used this moisturizer as apart of my daytime and night time skin care routine for about two weeks now and I love it! I have very oily skin and it moisturizes my skin while mattifying and preventing future breakouts. The other moisturizers I’ve used in the past have left my skin feeling and looking super greasy, but not this one. It also makes your foundation look smooth. The only downside to using this product is the smell. It doesn’t smell the very best but the benefits definitely outweigh the cons. This product is a 10/10. Best for oily skin!
