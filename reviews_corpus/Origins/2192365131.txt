The Origins Mega Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion claims to be a mushroom-infused light, soothing, watery liquid that reduces redness and preps skin for serum and moisturizer.  It claims to provide 3 ingredients known to soothe skin, support skin’s barrier, and non-irritant.  I have normal skin, so I was excited to see if this would hydrate and prep my skin.  Before using this product, I made sure to cleansed my face with my favorite cleanser.  Then, I dispensed this “lotion” on my hands and applied to my face.  I did notice that my skin felt hydrated after using this product, and then, I went forward with my routine.  Overall, I think that this product would be perfect for all skin types, such as sensitive, normal, dry oily, and combination.  However, I think the name of this product is confusing.  I wouldn’t call it a “Lotion”.  It is more-so like an essence because it is a watery liquid.  All in all, I would recommend this product, the Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion, to my family and friends. Origins Mega-Mushroom Treatment Lotion Review
