Fabulous for the gal who needs a night cream (or morning cream) that fights red cheeks and acne! My skin has been so much softer, brighter, and less red having used this one for the last year! I’m on my 2nd bottle as I interchange between creams (I use this at night). It worked so well with my oily t-zone and dry cheeks. Worth a try!! I’d buy it again!
