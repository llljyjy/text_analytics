I think that this face wash would be a great fit for someone who has oily skin. I have dry skin and my face felt extremely stripped and tight after using this. It did a good job at removing my makeup and other than making my face super dry, it did not irritate my skin. The scent is pretty neutral. The bottle comes with a good amount of product. I give it 4 stars because I do think it is a good product overall. Just not the right product for me. Better suited to someone with oily skin. Not for dry skin
