This instantly soothed my red/inflamed skin to promote healing and comfort right away. It also had a pleasant sent to it that was calming and was gentle on my skin. Plus, each bottle goes a long way as you only need a little bit of it to see the effects. I definitely recommend this lotion. Gentle/Soothing/Calming
