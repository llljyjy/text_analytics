I think that this moisturizer is amazing for oily skin. It really helps clear out pores and fight acne, yet keep you hydrated, but not greasy. It seems to go on a little grease but once it sinks in it’s perfect. The smell isn’t the best but it’s ok because I can get over it since it helped clear out my blackheads. great moisturizer
