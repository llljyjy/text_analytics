Despite the name, this is not a lotion, it’s a toner. It paired well with my other skincare products. Origins products have such refreshing, earthy scents, and this one is no different. I’ve only been using this for a week so hard to tell how effective it is for me, but hoping it helps out with my redness. Great smell! Feels refreshing
