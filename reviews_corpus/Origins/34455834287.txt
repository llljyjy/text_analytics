I found this lotion to be very lightweight. It’s a liquid lotion so it gets absorbed fast. I have very dry skin so I didn’t notice any major changes with the lotion. It is heavily scented but the smell lightens up after application. I have a lot of redness in my skin and I did notice that it reduced some of the redness but not all of it. Overall it’s a decent moisturizer but I probably wouldn’t purchase it since I tend to opt for more moisturizing lotions. Lightweight but heavily scented
