I’ve been using this product for over a year and I love it. I have very sensitive skin that is quick to flush and quick to breakout. I’m bad at sticking to a routine but this product is so easy to use every single day. I apply every morning with LastObject re-usable cotton rounds  - hydrating, calms my redness, and completely eliminated the textured bumps that I’d been struggling with on my forehead and chin. nan
