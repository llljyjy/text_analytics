Works great! Definitely give it a few weeks before making a judgement. I get random flare-ups or hormonal acne that attacks my entire jawline/cheeks and it just grows and grows once it starts. Within 3 weeks, over half of the acne spots are gone, and all of them are faded. I have one little patch that is resilient, but you can tell that it’s losing the battle.It doesn’t feel too drying, and I definitely use alot right now. I’ve used about 25% of the bottle in a week, so it doesn’t last too long BUT like I said, I’m using a ton all over my face to clear it up. Once it’s cleared up and I use it as an occasional spot treatment, it’ll definitely last longer. It’s so effective, so it doesn’t matter much to me.I wash my face with Kate Somerville Goat Milk Moisturizing Cleanser, then I use a generous amount of Origins Super Spot Remover™ Acne Treatment Gel (which has worked wonders the past 3 weeks to clear up my break up as well!), then I apply Murad InvisiScar Post-Acne Resurfacing Treatment, and then I finish with Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Hyaluronic Marine Oil-Free Moisture Cushion and Skinfix Barrier+ Triple Lipid-Boost 360° Brightening Eye Cream.Its incredible how much better my face looks after starting this new routine! Cleared up almost all my hormonal acne in 3 weeks!
