As a combination skin type with increasing maskne in the winter months, the Origins Check and balances Face Wash has been a much-needed addition to my skincare regimen. It lathers up very easily with just a touch of water and removes all the oils that build up underneath my mask during the day without overly stripping my skin. I have noticed a diminished number of acne spots on my face since starting to use it, particularly in my nose region. It is definitely my favorite cleanser, and I would re-buy this product and recommend this product to friends or family who are in search for effective products that truly clear your skin and keep it “balanced”. A must-have for oily/combo skin
