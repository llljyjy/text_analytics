Truly a one of a kind hydrating moisturizer. I often battle drums and redness and sometimes it gets triggered by stress and my skin gets super itchy, dry and flaky. This stuff is great because it’s gentle enough to target those areas but strong enough to truly hydrate. It definitely adds a bit of moisture in to restore the skin and I’m sure over a longer period does wonders. I definitely recommend if your skin requires a bit more TLC. Amazing
