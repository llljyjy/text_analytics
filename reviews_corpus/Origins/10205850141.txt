Overall I really like the PLANTSCRIPTIONâ„¢ Multi-Powered Youth Serum; it is lightweight and aids in a bright and radiant complexion. With that being said, I have only used the product for about two weeks and thus have not been able to truly test the claims regarding the products anti-aging benefits like relaxing the appearance of expression lines and a more lifted appearance. Ingredients like peptides and niacinamide do support these claims so I am excited to continue my use of the product. Right now, I would recommend this product to a friend but would really love to see my final results before giving a true stamp of approval. So Far, So Good
