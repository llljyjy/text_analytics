I have been using this treatment lotion in the wintertime for almost 4 years now, it is a great lotion on a cold day, dryness, irritation be gone. The thicker than water texture is easy to apply, it absorbs well and instantly relieves my skin. If you have dry skin, definitely recommend it. If you have sensitive skin, Iâ€™d give it a try. Love, please keep making it. Best winter treatment lotion
