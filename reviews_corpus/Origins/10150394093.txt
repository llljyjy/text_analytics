This lotion is very moisturizing. My skin absorbs it very quickly. It feels lightweight and has an earthy herbal scent. The texture is rather liquid that is why I prefer using cotton rounds. The bottle is huge, and the product will definitely last. My skin was red in few spots and this lotion did magic. Truly recommend. Moisture bomb
