The first time I opened the bottle, the scent reminded me of a visit to the spa. I experience redness from time to time, especially when I experience breakouts. When I used this product, it did not irritate my breakouts. It even out my redness a noticeable amount. There was also no residue after application. A little on a cotton round goes a long way. It should last a while. nan
