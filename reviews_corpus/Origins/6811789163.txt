The first time I used this, my skin felt a bit tingly and I was worried it might cause irritation, but after the first day, it stopped causing any weird sensations and started getting to work. I recently realized I was starting to get lines on my neck and between my eyebrows ( I scrunch my brow when concentrating). This started reduceding their appearance within a week and started making a noticeable difference after about 2-3 weeks. The scent is pleasant. It’s lightweight and absorbs well. I’m acne prone and was worried this would cause a breakout. But no. My skin is as clear and soft as ever. I’ll be adding this to my usual routine. nan
