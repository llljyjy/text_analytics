This is a great product for sensitive skin. It is not too thick so it really melts into your skin and i felt my skin much more even toned, less red, and smoother than before i started using this product. I love using it in the morning after using a more thick hydrating lotion at night and it gives me the perfect amount of added moisture. nan
