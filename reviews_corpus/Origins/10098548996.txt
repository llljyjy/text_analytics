I have sensitive combination skin and a very intricate daytime and nighttime skincare routine. For the past few weeks, I have replaced my daytime moisturizer with Origins Original Skin Matte Moisturizer with Willowherb. I love that this moisturizer is a third of the cost of my usual moisturizer and just as effective. I’m usually a fan of fragrance-free moisturizers, but I truly love how this one smells! I also love the consistency of this moisturizer- it’s thick but immediately melts into my skin leaving it feeling refreshed. The biggest perk is that it actually drys matte. Oftentimes, I leave the house not wearing any makeup at all, but I don’t always want my skin to look dewy the way most moisturizers leave it. This one actually reduces the shine. When I run out, I will likely repurchase. nan
