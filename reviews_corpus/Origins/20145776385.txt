No, this is not a creamy texture but water like liquidy like a toner but more hydrating than a toner so, I would call it essence. It’s very hydrating and I really enjoy using it in that aspect, my skin does feel calmed down after use and I’m happy to keep using it, I do believe this can make your skin strong. My problem with it comes to the fragrance, I want to know when it was a good idea to put patchouli in this. At the beginning it doesn’t bother me that much but it’s strong enough to smell this way for hours. And, patchouli is not one of my favorite smells when it’s by itself or is more potent than everything else. I believe this brand is headed in the right direction but it needs to reformulate and it come up with the same products but fragrance free. That’s my biggest issue with Origins. nan
