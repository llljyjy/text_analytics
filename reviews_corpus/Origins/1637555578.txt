I am not a fan of the products consistency. The product is a full liquid and hard to manage in your hands without getting it everywhere when trying to apply to a larger area. Once on, the product absorbs fast, but didn’t leave my dry skin feeling very moisturized. Living in Texas, I could see this product working well on hot/humid days as it’s fast drying no like a lotion. The product was also not sealed by a foil seal when I first got it, which I thought was strange. I got this as a free product to review and would not purchase for myself. Not my prefered consistancy
