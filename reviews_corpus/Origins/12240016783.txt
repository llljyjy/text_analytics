I have very dry and flaky skin specially around my t-zone. I tried many moisturizers but didn’t work at all. Origins original skin matte moisturizer is very lightweight and at the same time hydrates my skin for longer time and it doesn’t feel sticky or oily at all. I usually apply it during the day and night, and can see the great improvement. This is definitely worth trying if anyone has very dry skin. Great product!
