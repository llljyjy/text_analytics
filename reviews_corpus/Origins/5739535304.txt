This moisturizer feels amazing on the skin. Very light weight and mattifies a bit when applied. It has a slightly gray color and is a very gel like consistency. Iâ€™ve included an image of the ingredients too - note that there a lot of great ingredients and also a lot of essential oils. I am somewhat sensitive to the smells of essential oils so at first, it was alarming. However the smell dissipates the quickly and you are left with very pleasant remnants. Really enjoying this moisturizer and would recommend it, especially for those interested in natural ingredients. nan
