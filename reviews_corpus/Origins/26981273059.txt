I really love the liquid type of this lotion I did not use it before. It feels better on your skin, more fresh and hydrated. I love the smell, it was strange at the first time, but keep using it make me feel better and addict to the smell. My skin is dry, and this product helps me a lot on fulfill the hydration for a sunshine day. I love it! Recommended product for dry/ normal skin
