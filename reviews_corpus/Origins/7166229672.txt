Really great for dehydrated skin and redness. I found out that this works better if you pour it into a spray bottle to wet the skin! Rather then applying with a cotton pad an for example. It’s waste less product and easier since it’s a liquid form and not really a “lotion“ I think this works so well for me and should Def try it out for dryness. It works well whenever I apply my other skin care routine! nan
