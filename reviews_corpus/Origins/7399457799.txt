I love how much this cleanser foams up, and I love how a little bit of it goes a long way. I’ve been using it for a week, and I haven’t noticed any adverse effects. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft, and it doesn’t make my skin too dry afterwards either. Another plus is that it doesn’t have a strong fragrance. My only concern with using it is that it doesn’t offer any added benefits besides cleaning my face (i.e it doesn’t target any specific skin problem). However, overall, this is a great foamy cleanser! Foamy cleanser that leaves face feeling clean!
