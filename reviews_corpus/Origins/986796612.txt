I hate this cleanser and don’t know how this is even allowed on the market. The scrubbing beads DO NOT DISSOLVE. This is dangerous if you get them in your eyes, which is pretty much guaranteed to happen. The beads stick to your face, no matter how much you try to rinse them off. The cleanser itself is nothing special and the plastic beads don’t even exfoliate. This needs to be taken off the market. Don't get this near your eyes!
