I am always out seeking soothing products for the skin so was very excited to give this a try. This treatment lotion is incredibly easy to incorporate into my routine and has a very watery texture that absorbs well into my skin. I have really enjoyed adding it to my routine and feel that it sets a nice starting point for the rest of my products as well. nan
