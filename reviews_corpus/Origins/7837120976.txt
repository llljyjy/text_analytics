This product has been a life saver! Living in a sunny colorado can definitely take a toll on someoneâ€™s skin, both because of the sunny weather but also the dryness. This lotion has been super moisturizing and has been great to use even when my skin has been sunburnt! Would definitely recommend it! Great lotion for dry skin!
