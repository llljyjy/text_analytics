This is a pretty good face wash and it’s got a nice, subtle minty smell to it. The consistency is a bit thick so if you use too much it’s kinda a pain to take off so keep in mind a little goes a long way. It definitely left my face very clean but I recommend a good moisturizer after because it’s a tiny bit drying otherwise I liked it quite a bit. Squeaky clean
