This lotion is the perfect first layer of hydration before I put on my moisturizing lotion. Though it is watery, it allows me to put on two layers of moisturizer - First this layer of hydration, and second my normal facial moisturizer. I found that my skin has been more calm in the past few weeks of using this product. It looks less irritated and less red. I also like to use this on my face before my shower to protect my skin barrier. I will be re-purchasing. Good first layer of hydration
