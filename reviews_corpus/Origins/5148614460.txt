I have been using Origins-mega mushroom for about a month now and I do like it! It is soothing and not sticky/oily. My skin definitely wants to soak it all in. I also really like how the product is packaged. The green bottle makes it seem very earthy and I just really like the look. I will add that I haven’t noticed a drastic change in my skin texture: I have combination skin: however, sometimes I feel products like this can sometimes clog me up/cause break outs but I haven’t had any real big breakouts! Perhaps, in the end, this treatment lotion is helping keeping my acne at bay and hydrated! I definitely plan on continuing to use! Soothing
