After using this serum for a few weeks I’ve noticed my skin feeling softer, plumper and just overall healthier looking. I have dark spots and texture and this serum has really helped in making my skin look more youthful overall. It has a very slight scent but nothing noticeable after it’s on your face. It feels silky and moisturizing after application. I’ve been reaching for this over my other favorite skincare products. I’ll definitely be purchasing after it’s gone. It’s become a staple in my skincare routine. Highly recommend! wonderful and effective serum
