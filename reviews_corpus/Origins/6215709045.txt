I received this product as a Sephora sampler (pack of 3 or 4 mini pouches?) & I have to say, I’m excited to buy the full size. This product is a godsend for us oily girls. I don’t mean those who feel a little oily, i mean my oil slick by afternoon folks - the true oily skin types. Anyone who is dry or combo will hate this product as it doesn’t have enough moisture for you. It also helped with some acne I’d been having. As always, please remember to allergy test your products or you’ll end up like a couple reviews below. This product has a nice light scent & it really does keep your skin matte through the day & under makeup, but it isn’t perfect. Skin will have some oil (which is normal) & I almost wish it was JUST a tad more moisturizing. All in all, holy grail skincare product for the oily skin warriors! oil slick no more!
