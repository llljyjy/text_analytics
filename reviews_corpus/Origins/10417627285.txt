This product comes out like a toner, so I think it is best to use with a cotton ball or beauty wipe versus trying to apply with your hands/ fingers. The first time I used it the product came out kind of fast and I was not expecting it to. I like that this product is not tacky or sticky at all! It feels very light and clean. I feel hydrated without feeling weighed down. I think I have seen a bit of a more even tone/ skin color with this product so far already but I do want to give it more time! The product will go a long way so I think it is absolutely worth the money! Great Lightweight and Hydrating Product
