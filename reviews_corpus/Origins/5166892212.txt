Initially, I thought this face lotion was going to be a cream of some sort, but it is a liquid! The most efficient way to utilize this product would be to use cotton pads or cotton balls. I have very dry, sensitive skin that gets irritated rather easily. The scent of this treatment lotion is refreshing, but not strong enough to bother my skin. I tend to get a little bit of redness around my nose, but nothing too crazy. Not only does this hydrate my dehydrated skin prior to applying a cream, but it helps to diminish the appearance of that redness! I love mushroom in my beauty products, they have done so much justice! Hydrating!
