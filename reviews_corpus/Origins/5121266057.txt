I got a sample size and really love how soft it makes your skin feel! It absorbs so well and doesn’t look greasy. Two things stopping me from buying the full size are: I prefer tube or bottle packaging so you aren’t sticking your fingers in a jar every day (unsanitary) and the horrible smell. it smells like bad tourist coconut sunscreen yuck. I could probably get over the packaging if only I could get rid of the smell; I’d buy a truck full of this moisturizer if it was unscented. feels good but yuck smell
