The formula definitely fooled me! I was expecting literally a lotion whereas it reminds me of a toner. I find that I need to apply a moisturizer after using this but I think it works very well! My skin has been breaking out and itâ€™s done a good job soothing those blemishes. More of a toner versus a lotion!
