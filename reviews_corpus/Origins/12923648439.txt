I was excited to review this lotion AKA toner until I found out that it has MANY harmful ingredients, essential oils and comedogenic ingredients. I still have it a try, and it broke me out badly. I have skin that can take a punch and don’t break out often, so that’s saying something. It gave me horrible cystic acne all over my cheeks, chin and forehead after only 4 uses. Avoid this product. It contains essential oils that are known irritants and can break you out easily or worse.Also, to the people complaining that this isn’t a lotion, TONERS ARE ALSO CALLED LOTIONS. Expand your knowledge of the things you put on your skin. Lotion does not equal a cream . Avoid this product. Too many irritants.
