I really enjoyed using this cream. Texture was really nice and light. Absorbs very well into my skin with very nice glowing finish. My skin felt very hydrated and fresh. However I have very dehydrated aging skin, live in very dry environment. So this cream wasnâ€™t for me at night. I would definitely continue using it for my AM ritual. Love the texture!
