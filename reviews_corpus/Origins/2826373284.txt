I love this cream! Right off the bat, the smell is so amazing and not over whelming. It feels amazing with my morning skin care and is very resfeshing and hydrating on the skin. I have pretty oily skin and it never feels to heavy or oily. I also love to use this as a base before I put on my makeup. nan
