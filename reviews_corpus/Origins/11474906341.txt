I have used many different brands and types of face moisturizers and serums. I appreciate that this moisturizer has SPF, and the container gives you a lot of product for the price. It also smells great - a very light, clean smell. I used it for over a week and tried not to put much on my face, but regardless it doesn’t rub in well and halfway through the day my face was always extra shiny/oily. I don’t have sensitive skin, but I found that this made my skin irritated and itchy! I took a week break and tried it again for a few more days to make sure it wasn’t a fluke, but the same thing happened. nan
