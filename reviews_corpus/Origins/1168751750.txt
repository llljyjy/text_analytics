I received a free sample of this “treatment lotion“ to try and was excited to try it. However, upon receiving it I was disappointed. It’s definitely not a lotion as it is way too thin, it’s a liquid. I suppose you could use it as a toner or something of the sort. However, it’s not a moisturizing lotion as I was led to believe. Also, I was instantly put off by the overpowering herbal smell that lingers. I also don’t believe this to be soothing as it contains salicylic acid which is drying. I won’t be using this as I wanted a gentle facial moisturizer, not a toner. nan
