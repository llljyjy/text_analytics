This youth serum smells amazing and feels amazing too! I put about 2 pumps on my face day and night, and love the way it makes my skin feel. It’s not greasy or heavy feeling, but more of a penetrating serum. I haven’t noticed any significant improvements  with my skin since using it, but it’s definitely something I would continue to use. I wanted to wait 2 full weeks before I wrote a review to really give it a chance to work. My skin does feel more hydrated, but that’s about it. Not your typical serum!
