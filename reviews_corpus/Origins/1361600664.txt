Best mask ever. I use masks every other day and I like ones from origins, Clinique, Peter Thomas Roth and other luxury brands. Glam glow masks can be a little harsh. THIS MASK IS THE BEST! It detoxes like the Kiehls clay mask but doesnâ€™t dry. It makes my skin glows and smooth like the caudalie detox mask but also kind of seems to even skin tone a little more and helps my products absorb after. My trick is use a hot wet washcloth after washing with a gentle cleanser to open up pores and soften skin, Pat dry very lightly, then use a brush to apply this mask everywhere but lips and eyes, leave on for 20-30 mins as I blow dry my hair, then wipe off with a warm wet washcloth and apply my serums, lotions and makeup! nan
