This does smell a bit earthy and not very good tbh. But I can get over the scent. It doesn’t linger. The consistency is like water. It’s very thin. I don’t think the traditional squeeze bottle is the right applicator for this. I think they should have used something more precise and les messy. I don’t think a dropper would work because of the size of the bottle but would make it easier to apply.Now onto the actual performance of the product. I do like that because it’s such a thin texture it soaks into the skin almost immediately. It really is light and refreshing. It doesn’t break me out which is always a plus. It doesn’t burn my skin when applied. It seems like a more gentle formula. I appreciate that it’s alcohol free! This product is perfect for someone looking for a lightweight, more gentle and natural soothing treatment product! nan
