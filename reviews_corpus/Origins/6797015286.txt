The Origins Checks and Balances face wash is gentle, but also wakes you up with its minty scent. You also don’t need a lot as it foams up nicely and leaves your face clean without over drying. The one thing I must say is that it has the consistency and smell of toothpaste so if that puts you off this one isn’t for you. Refreshing!
