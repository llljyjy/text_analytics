This product seems to have great expectations, almost like an all in one for all your skin care needs, but does not deliver. The first issue is the smell. While bearable, it does have a charcoal smell similar to masks, not a moisturizer. I guess the Bamboo charcoal in the name gives this away. The second is a consistency. I had to keep looking at the box to ensure it was not a mask. It does have a thick texture to it. Third, it really didnâ€™t have any effects on my skin. Just ok
