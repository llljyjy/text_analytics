I am extremely pleased with this product! I usually apply it after washing my face each night by applying a small amount to a cotton round. The smell is certainly distinct, but I weirdly love it. It feels super soothing on the face and helps to relax me before bed. Since I started using this product, I have not had one break out. I also used this after getting a lot sun on my face at the beach and it helped to prevent any peeling from occurring. Iâ€™ll definitely be buying another bottle once this one is up! Would definitely recommend. Great Product
