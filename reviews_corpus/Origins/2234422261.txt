I really enjoyed this product, the smell is very pleasant, floral but somehow reminds me of artichokes (but in a good way, lol). The texture is lovely, it feels hydrating but drys down to a nice finish, would probably play well with face makeup. The packaging by feels pretty lux, it is a lot of plastic which is a bummer, Would be great if they could figure out a glass/aluminum solution. As far as it’s effectiveness I feel like it’s generally plumping, I don’t think I saw any improvement in color unevenness but my texture has improved. nan
