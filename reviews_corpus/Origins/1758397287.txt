I struggle with psoriasis and sensitive skin so I’m pretty picky with my skincare. I’ve only been using it for a week (give or take) but this lotion soothed the scaly psoriasis patches around my nose wonderfully. I would definitely buy this again and recommend to anyone looking for a way to add more moisture to their skin care routine nan
