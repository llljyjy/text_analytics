My skin has never been softer! I’m prone to breakouts and had just run out of my usual acne treatments so I was expecting to break out while waiting for my replacement even with the facial wash, but I’m doing just as well, if not better, with this wash instead! I’ve only had it for about two weeks so it isn’t THAT impressive that my skin’s remained clear, but I’m very happy with what I got! nan
