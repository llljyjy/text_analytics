This type of product was very new to me and my skin, but boy are we happy we discovered it! It does exactly what the name says, it provides relief and soothes your skin. After a long day of work or after working out, washing my face first and then applying this is like heaven. It calmed any redness and hydrated my skin nicely and my skin still felt amazing when waking up in the morning. nan
