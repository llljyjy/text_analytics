So far I like this product and it feels good on the skin. I do love the way it smells. I’ve only used it a few times and it is a good moisturizer but I was hoping to see a little more help with the very slight redness in a few spots I get if I have a pimple or two. It’s not like I’m trying to erase rosacea, so in that area it could’ve delivered more. Other than that I will keep using this bottle I already purchased - but unless something changes after using an a while longer I probably will not re-purchase. Pretty good
