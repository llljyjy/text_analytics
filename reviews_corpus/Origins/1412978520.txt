I really enjoyed this facewash but there are a few things that weren’t my favorite. First off, I didn’t love how I had to avoid the eye area. Do you know how difficult it is to wash your face avoiding the eye area. It was also annoying because after washing my face with this I had to use something else to wash the make up off my eyes. I  really liked the thickness of the cleanser but it did remind me a lot like rubbing toothpaste all over my face. I loved how it made my skin feel so silky clean and smooth after washing though. pretty good
