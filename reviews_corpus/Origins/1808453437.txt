I was surprised about the texture but not in a bad way.  It’s more of a liquid lotion than cream and I like that better for the warmer temperatures because other products feel heavy. I don’t have the heavy feeling on my skin with this.  It doesn’t leave an oily residue and hydrated my skin.  It helped me during the change of weather as my skin gets all crazy but my skin didn’t even get close to how it usually gets & I thank this for it.  Definitely going to be picking up more to have my skin ready in September. Soothing & cooling
