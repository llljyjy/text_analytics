This was probably my least favorite product ever! I used this for three days, and took photos to track my progress. This broke me out in the most odd pimples, I thought it was a bad rash and wasnâ€™t sure what had caused it. I thought perhaps my skin was purging. But I think my skin just hated this and perhaps the Salicylic Acid in this. If I could give this negative stars I would. Absolute worst
