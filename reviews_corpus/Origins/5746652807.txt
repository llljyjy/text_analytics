I’m blown away with this stuff.. I had crazy redness on my skin and was breaking out like mad; which hasn’t happened to me in a long time (I’m blaming stress stress stress) I used this one night along with my regular moisturizer (MAKE A DIFFERENCE™ PLUS+ REJUVENATING MOISTURIZER) I went to bed, woke up with all the redness gone 100% gone. I was shocked looked at myself in the mirror for a good 10 minutes redness gone. The acne scars that I had gotten over the few days of my breakouts were incredibly more light and almost completely gone, the breakouts that we’re starting to come through the night before those were gone. Definitely try
