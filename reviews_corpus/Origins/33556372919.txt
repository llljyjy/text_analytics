I tend to have relatively mild acne, but I always have blackheads/clogged pores around my nose. I began using this product in the hopes that it would get rid of some of those blackheads, without me having to do physical extractions of the blackheads, which leaves my skin red and irritated, and sometimes breaks the skin. I have generally used this product at night time, either under or on top of my other nightly products. The lotion is a grey color, which on first thought I feared would make my skin look dull, but that is not the case at all. When I rub in the moisturizer, if becomes colorless on my skin. The moisturizer itself feels very lightweight - not greasy. It has a wonderful, minty, menthol scent, which makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. I have not experienced any irritation to my eyes as a result of the smell. The packaging warns that this product might be drying, when used with other topical acne medications, as it contains salicylic acid, but I havenâ€™t found that to be the case, even around my eyes. The product is great as a moisturizer, and I do think I have seen an improvement in the quantity and severity of the blackheads around my nose. Would definitely recommend nan
