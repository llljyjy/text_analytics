I have used this lotion for about 2 weeks and noticed a significant difference in the overall health of my skin. It is calm, smooth and moisturized. My makeup goes on smoother as well as my skin looks glowing from within. The lotion itself is very light and acts almost as a toner. I would highly recommend this product if you are trying to use a gentle product to combat redness and moisturize skin. Smoothing and Calming
