This face wash is true to its name! It gets very frothy which is great if you like having a ‘sudsy’ face when washing. I also use an exfoliating brush and it goes on very smooth and helps me feel like I’m giving myself a deep clean. After rinsing, it left my face feeling cool and very clean. It’s almost like mouthwash for your face in that it leaves you feeling cool and refreshed! So far, so good! I’d definitely recommend to anyone as I have fairly sensitive skin and it hasn’t made me break out or become dry or oily. A little goes a long way as well, so I foresee this bottle lasting me a while which is great for the price. Gives a Deep Clean with a "Cool" After Feeling
