I’m so happy with the Origins Mega - Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion. It delivers as it promises. It super hydrating and soothing while being very light in consistency.  It’s non-sticky and sinks right into my skin. It plumps my skin, balances out redness and helps strengthen my skin’s natural barrier. It calms and relieves my skin when I have flare ups. I cleanse my face and then pour some into my hands and pat it onto my damp skin. My skin drinks it up and it feels so fresh in the morning. The scent is pleasant and non-offensive in this product. I’ve already recommended it to so many of my friends. I just love it !! Origins saved my skin !!
