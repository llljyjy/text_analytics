I received this product as a free sample. I was quite excited to try this product on my skin since the specifications recommend it for dry and irritable skin. I am pleased to announce that this product not only met my expectations but far exceeded them. It has a soft and light texture, so it is easily and quickly absorbed. After a week of applying it, I have noticed that my skin is brighter and smoother. It is spectacular for sensitive skin, especially after waxing, it is also quite refreshing. As soon as I finish my sample I will go buy more! Easy and fast absorption
