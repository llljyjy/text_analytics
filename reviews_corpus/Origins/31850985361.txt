This product is extremely gentle and lightweight, which is especially important for my sensitive skin. I apply it after cleansing with my hands, not with cotton pads. I find that it takes a few seconds to dry (which is good because I hate drying alcohols) but once it’s dry, my face isn’t tacky feeling. I find that I don’t need to add another layer of hyaluronic serum afterward for daytime wear, but I like the added boost for nighttime. Gentle and lightweight
