Game changer! I have combination skin so it’s very hard for me to find a moisturizer that is perfect for my skin. Origin matte arrived to me unexpectedly and I didn’t dare to put my hope up. From now on, I stick with this moisturizer. It feels so smooth and gentle with a lovely smell. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin hydrated. Picture is my skin applied moisturizer after serum. I love it! nan
