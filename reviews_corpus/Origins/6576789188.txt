I give 2 stars because the product description is not in line with the actual product. In the description it says it’s a moisturizer intended for dry skin and it has UV protection in it. However, it is simply sunscreen. The product packaging describes it as such, it smells like sunscreen, it applies like sunscreen. I’m sure it works great as a sunscreen, but I bought it under the impression it was a moisturizer that also had SPF in it because that’s how it’s described. Love this brand but if you’re looking for a moisturizer, this isn’t it! this is sunscreen.
