Just ordered maybe my 4th (?) tube of this. It’s never broken me out, and I don’t think the scent smells artificial or overpowering. Does smell delicious though. I use this every night as a moisturizer and every morning I wake up glowing but not oily. Even if I’m feeling lazy and skip most of my routine, I always at least cleanse and put this mask on. It’s just so nice. Everything I need in a night moisturizer.
