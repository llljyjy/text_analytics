This is the best matte moisturizer I’ve ever used. My skin gets so oily throughout the day, but with this moisturizer it keeps the oiliness at bay for much longer. It doesn’t leave a weird film or pill or make your skin feel dry and weird like other matte moisturizers can. I still feel like I’ve actually been moisturized! It also helps make a nice base for makeup. Love :)
