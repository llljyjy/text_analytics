I was disappointed in this serum. I felt as if it dried out all the other skincare products I use in my skincare routine. Leaving my skin looking a tad bit dry. What I did like about this serum, was how smooth and bright it left my skin, and caused no breakouts. I would only recommend this product to people who have oily skin, mainly because of how dry my skin looks and felt after using this serum. nan
