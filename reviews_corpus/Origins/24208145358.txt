I really enjoyed using this face wash. It had a really gentle formula that did not irritate my skin at all and left my skin feeling really soft after the wash. You really only need a little bit each use because as you rub it on your face, it begins to foam up. Would recommend to people with more sensitive skin and looking for an everyday gentle cleanser. Loved it!
