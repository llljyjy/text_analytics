The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell. I’m usually not a fan of fragrance in products but this smelled exactly like an orange. The smell does not linger. It applied well on my face and did not leave a sticky residue. I wish it came with a tiny product spoon and spatula so I wouldn’t have to touch a lot of product when I use it. Over all, it’s great and I’m excited to use the whole tub. nan
