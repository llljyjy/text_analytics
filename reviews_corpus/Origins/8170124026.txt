I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this doesn’t make my skin itch. It feels very moisturizing. I wear it under makeup and at night since it doesn’t have spf in it. Doesn’t feel sticky. Smells very light and fresh, just like the charcoal face mask. Overall, highly recommended. Great for sensitive acne prone skin
