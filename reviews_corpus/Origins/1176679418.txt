This product may work really for some, but it caused skin issues for me. After using this product a few times, I started getting milia on my face and sometimes having a breakout. I haven’t had a breakout since I was in high school and I’m 37 yrs old now. I use an exfoliator 2-3 times a week too but it still caused milia. I am definitely dumping this product.
