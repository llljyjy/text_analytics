I quite like this origins mask! This charcoal honey mask has a cooling effect as it dries - and it goes on very smoothly. The mask is very pretty and dries in about 15 minutes. I use it once a week to help keep my skin clear and nourished. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good price point and enough applications to last a couple months when used once a week. Helps with my dry winter skin!
