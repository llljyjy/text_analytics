I have dry, puffy eyes and this was recommended to me. I bought the it full-size in the original shade, mainly because the packaging of the mini wasn’t appealing to me. I’m about halfway through the jar and it’s ’meh’ at best. The good: The colour is super sheer, which leaves a nice shimmer/highlight under the eye. The bad: It’s not hydrating, the shimmer dried and creased under my eyes after a few hours. It also did nothing to depuff my tired eyes. I’m now layering it on top of Clinique’s All About Eyes Rich for the shimmer. I won’t rebuy. Meh.
