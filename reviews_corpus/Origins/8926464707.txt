I love this product! It gives great hydration, soothes inflammation (I have sensitive skin that gets red really easily), is non-oily & doesnâ€™t clog my pores (am rather acne-prone), feels clean and light and I really like the natural, earthy smell of it. Highly recommend! Light, healing, hydrating, lovely
