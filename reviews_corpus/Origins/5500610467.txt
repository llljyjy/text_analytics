I received a full-size complimentary for reviewing purposes but all thoughts are my own. I first used up a travel size of this treatment lotion a while ago, not knowing much about it, but I loved the sample. It’s something that really has helped my skin recently as I’ve been trying to heal my skin after a horrible reaction to a skincare product that caused redness and itchiness all over my face and neck. This treatment lotion has been helping build up my skin’s resilience and it doesn’t irritate it at all. It leaves my skin feeling super soft too. It’s a bit drying, so I recommend using this if you have oily or combination skin because if you have drier skin, I think you might not like it as much. Overall, I really like this treatment lotion and will definitely repurchase it in the future. Love this for my combo-sensitive skin!
