I love this product . I tried a lot of origins products but this one by far has given me the best results! I’ve noticed my smile lines are less visible and has given me  supple soft skin! I’m a huge fan of the smell! It’s smells earthy! It’s a very calming smell! The texture is great ! Absorbs into my skin fast and easy. I usually don’t like when a serum sits on my skin for 5 mins but this has pleasantly surprised me! Highly recommended it! Clean earthy serum!!Love it!
