I’m very pleased with how this product worked on my skin. For someone with sensitive skin, I’m hesitant to use new products. The soothing lotion truly gives my skin a lovely, refreshed, and rehydrated feeling that I look forward to. It has a light and non-sticky consistency and adds some very delicious hydration to my skin. I’m so extremely pleased with this product. nan
