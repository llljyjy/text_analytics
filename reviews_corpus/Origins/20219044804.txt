First off, I love that this moisturizer is oil-free and vegan. I have acne-prone skin so I do not feel bad about putting this on my face thanks to the Salicylic Acid. I was scared to put it on my face at first because I am also on prescribed acne medicine, but everything turned out fine and I had no issues. Will definitely be finishing the jar. nan
