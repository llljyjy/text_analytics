I never knew I needed this product until I received it for free from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. This product is similar to an essence or toner. It’s made to be the second step in your routine, applied before serum. Pour some into your hands and pat it onto clean skin. It applies with such ease and absorbs nicely! I have combination skin- so that is saying a lot! It has a pharmaceutical-grade/earth-like scent to it, which makes me feel like it’s more effective and enjoy the product that much more! I will be purchasing this again when I run out and I would recommend Origins Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion to those with pore probs! nan
