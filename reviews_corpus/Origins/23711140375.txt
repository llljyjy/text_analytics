I have oily dehydrated skin with big pores. I love Origins products so I was happy to be able to try this one. I like that this has 1% salicylic acid which is great for keeping my acne in check. The moisturizer was a little bit too thick for me, but it did absorb into my skin OK. It has a nice smell to it. This moisturizer would probably be better for those with dry skin compared to oily skin. nan
