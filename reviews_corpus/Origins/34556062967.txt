This product is not greasy but hydrates well.  I love that my skin is so soft and supple.  I have not had any breakouts, flaky skin and I can feel that my face can “breathe” due to no pore clogging and no greasy film.  My blackheads have reduced dramatically and I have radiance again.  The minty feel is refreshing, smooth and not overpowering or irritating.  I first got a tiny sample free from Sephora and used it every day for over a week.  A little goes a long way.  I must add that you HAVE to wash your face thoroughly twice a day before applying.  Even if you don’t wear makeup the bacteria from just normal environmental objects that you touch can transfer to your face.  I am going to order the whole mini kit so that I can see if everything is as great as this product.  I use cera ve hydrating cleanser but have found that their bar soap feels cleaner and leaves my skin as a clean palette ready to soak up Origins Clear Improvement Moisturizer, rather than the pump moisturizing cleanser that feels more like an oily lotion.  Oh!  And this Origins moisturizer is a great primer, I use it EVERY time before my foundation because it fills in to the pores and does not allow the foundation to soak in but allows it to still coat and feel creamy and can use anything from full coverage to light wear.  Let your Origins have a few minutes to dry and soak in before applying foundation.  Best when used immediately after cleaning your face.  Best product that I have found so far.  I’m 49 & began to loose my youthful glow until I started using this!  Hormonal breakouts around my chin and jawline are gone and have not returned.  Great for any age! Refreshed face with moisture non-oily acne control
