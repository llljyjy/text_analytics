Works for me most of the time. Sometimes it just dries out my skin but it helps my pimple go down most of the time. I like that it stings(feels like it’s working) and has a minty scent smells so much better than inkey list spot treatment. It’s tiny and cute but lasts a while. I’m also happy it’s clear so it’s not too obvious. nan
