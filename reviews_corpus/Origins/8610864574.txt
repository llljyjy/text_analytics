My favorite!My old mattifying moisturizer was discontinued, so this was recommended to me. I tried this along with several other mattifying moisturizers. This was not only better than the ones I tried, it was better than my old one. Thank you, Origins! Donâ€™t change a thing! It mattifies, moisturizes just right, smells amazing, reduces my pore size, and feels wonderful! I will continue to buy this and have already gone through 3 containers- so I know I love it- been using it for a while now. It also keeps shine away all day! My favorite!
