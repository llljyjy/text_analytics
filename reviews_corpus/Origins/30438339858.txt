This is my new favorite day/night moisturizer. The texture is exactly what’s described – a gel like texture cream. It sinks into the skin like a dream! Extremely lightweight and cooling (and exactly what I love since I’m not a huge fan of thick and heavy moisturizers). I also find it being a great base for my makeup, while being extremely hydrating and not greasy at all. This is a fragrant product (smells like an orange starburst when first applied, but quickly dies down to a very light, uplifting citrus scent). Lightweight and does wonders!
