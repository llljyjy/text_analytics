I absolutely love this lotion. I personally love to use it as a face moisturizer but it is good to use on any part of your body. Makes your skin feel refreshed, relaxed & rejuvenated. The texture is watery but doesnâ€™t feel oily which I love. Has a soft, pleasant smell! Definitely a must buy, especially for sensitive skin nan
