Thank you for the opportunity to try Origins Original Skin Matte Moisturizer.  I was very excited to try this product because of the willowherb as I assumed that this moisturizer would be very hydrating.  Unfortunately I found that my skin was left still fairly dry after using for a few days.  I’m a little disappointed as a result because I usually love Origins.  Not a fan of the orange scent either.  While I enjoy fragrance in most products I absolutely despise the orange scent.  So sad this didn’t work for me. Not for me
