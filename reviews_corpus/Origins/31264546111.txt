I used to LOVE this and it was my go-to nighttime moisturizer. I’m not sure if the formula changed, but I don’t find that it hydrates the skin as much. Also it began to break me out (only product in my routine that changed), once I stopped using it my skin was fine. It’s a nice, lightweight cream and feels fresh on the face with a lovely scent. I’m sad I can’t really use it anymore but the price point is quite high. I’ve switched to the Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA, it works amazing and it’s only $6! nice cream
