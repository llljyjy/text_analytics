I was curious to try this product since it is suppose to help with breakouts, but it doesn’t seem to give my skin enough moisture when I use it. I live in a currently cold climate, and sometimes feel like I still need to use moisturizer even after two layers of using this. Plus, it has a funny smell - not a big deal since added fragrances in moisturizers isn’t helpful either. Overall, not my favorite. nan
