This is my second time getting a chance to try another Origins product and Iâ€™m very much liking this brand. This goes on very smooth and it is mild. I have oily skin and it seems to work very well for my skin type. It feels refreshing to my skin and it smells good too. I definitely recommend giving this a try! nan
