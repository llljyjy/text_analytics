The Mega Mushroom Relief and Resilience Soothing Lotion by origins has a lightweight formula. It has a fresh slight scent that goes well with it’s watery consistency. I would say this lotion works more as a toner as it’s refreshing and an ideal step 2 before mositurizer. So far I’ve found the formula to be hydrating and has helped reduce redness from acne a bit. Definitely love this product so far and can’t wait to try other products from this collection. Hydrating Product
