I’ve been using this nonstop. I have combo skin with a very oily T-zone and this has done wonders for me. It hydrates my skin really well and at the same time keeps my oily zones under control. Most moisturizers make my t-zone extremely oily throughout the day but not this. I’m going to love using this during the summertime. Also it layers nicely under my makeup. No irritation or breaking out has occurred. I definitely recommend this. Also smells so nice. Amazing
