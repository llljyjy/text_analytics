I was pleasantly surprised! Anything with matte in the title generally makes me break out so I made sure to really give it time before reviewing.  It has a nice fragrance that’s light, it moisturized really well,  it didn’t leave me feeling oily,  and my make up application was much more smooth.  All of that with no break outs. I’m loving it and will continue to purchase. Pleasantly surprised
