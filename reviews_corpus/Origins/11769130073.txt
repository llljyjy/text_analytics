I have really sensitive skin so I was primarily using this on my nose area. While trying this I didnâ€™t break out surprisingly, but the scent on this made me cautious. Usually high fragrance skin care make break out. Although this smelled like vapor rub vics to me! I think i have to use it longer to see any improvements. nan
