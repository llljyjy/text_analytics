I had really high hopes for this as it was highly recommended online, but it didn’t deliver unfortunately. At first I did find it soothing, however after about a week and a half I noticed I was breaking out in irregular areas. I also noticed this contains salicylic acid which definitely does not calm the skin and is quite drying. It’s not terrible but for my sensitive acne prone skin it just didn’t work very well. disappointed
