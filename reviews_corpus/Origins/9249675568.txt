I was surprised by the consistency when first trying this product. It is marketed as a lotion but in my opinion it is more like a toner. It is very liquidy. Nevertheless it works extremely well. After a two weeks continued regular use i can see a difference in the appearance of my combination mildly sensitive skin and the texture. My skin feels softer than before and it has calmed the redness i experience on my cheeks.i also like that this didn’t make my skin feel sticky and that it wasn’t overly fragranced. nan
