As someone with dry skin prone to the occasional breakout, it can be a tough balancing act to find products that combat acne while not parching my delicate skin. This mask from Origins does a great job in hydrating and nourishing my skin while also drawing out inpurities. When I wash this off, my skin feels softer and looks more radiant. I also notice breakouts resolve more quickly, too. Oh, not to mention, the glittery gold/black color of the mask looks super cool. What more could you ask for? Perfect addition to your routine
