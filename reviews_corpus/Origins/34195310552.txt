I thought this was going to be thick like a regular lotion, it’s not. It’s very liquid-y. I feel like a lot of it seeps into my hands and goes to waste. It did calm my skin down but I honestly feel like it’s not worth the price. I received this product complimentary from bzzagent in exchange for my honest review. Didn't like it
