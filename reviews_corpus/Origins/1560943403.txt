I haven’t tried a charcoal mask in awhile. I used to be a BIG fan of the Glamglow charcoal mask back when it was really trendy, but I have dry skin and these tend to leave me dry so I stopped. I like that this mask has honey to somewhat offset the drying sensation. The consistency is nice and it’s easy to wash off. I didn’t notice a drastic change but my skin felt cleaner and I enjoyed using this. nan
