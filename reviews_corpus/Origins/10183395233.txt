First off the packaging for this serum is so cute. I love the formula it’s unlike any other serum I’ve ever tried. It is smooth and thick. No stickiness and it sinks right into the skin. I love how it hydrates my skin and has been shrinking my pores. No overpowering fragrance also. Skin is bouncy and feels renewed. Possibly the best serum I've ever tried.
