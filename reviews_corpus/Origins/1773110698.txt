It’s been a hot second since I tried an Origins product. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The watery consistency helps the product skin right in to the skin. I don’t like to layer too many products in the morning and during the summer months so this is perfect and my new go to! I love using this with a moisturizer  on my lazy days. It’s a large bottle so I know this will last me through the year. nan
