This product claims to help with pores, dryness, and redness which I have all three as far as my skin is concerned. During the summer months, my skin is really red. I thought of giving this a try to see if it would work to help reduce the redness because it is calming and soothing. I did see a little bit of calmness within my skin. As far as pores, I’m not sure it helped too much with that and dryness I feel like the product isn’t thick enough. The consistency is a bit on the thinner side. The scent is also really herbal like and a lot of people might not be into that. So for a $38 lotion, this one would be a pass for me. nan
