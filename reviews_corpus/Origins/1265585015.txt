So far since using this I’m not a huge fan which sucks because I really wanted to love this moisturizer. It kind of has burning sensation when I apply this to my skin so Some ingredients don’t agree with me in this. However I do love the smooth silky texture  that doesn’t leave my face  greasy or my pores feeling clogged. It smells good as well, like a Rosie and herbal scent. Not for me, sadly.
