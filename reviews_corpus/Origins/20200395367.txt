I love this sample pack, the fact that the oil-free moisturizer is only 20ml less then the full-sized product. I’ve gotten to enjoy the other products as well.The cleanser has a minty-ness to it that I don’t enjoy. The charcoal face mask I’ve used on my boyfriend and he enjoys it!The youth serum I haven’t seen much benefit from but it makes skincare enjoyable to use. And the lotion is more watery then I expected but nice. Worth trying it alll!
