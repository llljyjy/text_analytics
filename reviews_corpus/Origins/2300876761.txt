I have an oily t-zone but my cheeks tend to be on the dryer side so I like to use a gel moisturizer that isn’t too heavy. This definitely was a good match for me. I don’t have any complaints. It’s a good everyday moisturizer, just don’t use it with vitamin c if you’re using in the morning because the moisturizer contains niacinamide which doesn’t react well. Overall, a good product! Good for everyday
