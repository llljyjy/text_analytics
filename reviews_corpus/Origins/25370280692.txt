So I have been using this for 3 days already and its the bomb! I have a sensitive acne prone skin and I know when I am sensitive to a product because I get pimple marks right away but with this one, it was ZERO! Instead I got a fresher and cleaner looking skin despite my pimple marks! I love the fresh and minty scent and how soft and smooth it glides on the face without being oily and still creating the ting bubbles. It’s not watery at all which is what I love also cause I don’t waste much of it if it accidentally tipped.  Definitely recommend! Clean and fresh!
