I really enjoyed using this eye cream. The consistency is slightly think/creamy and absorbs nicely. I have dark circles and while using this daily it did help brighten my under eyes but nothing significant to where I would want to repurchase. Overall it is a good eye cream and perfect for those who have slight under eye darkness.  One con I would say is if applied too liberally it does cause concealer to pull. Solid eye cream
