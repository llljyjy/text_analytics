After cleansing I put a thin layer on my cheeks where my skin was broken out. Within minutes I noticed the redness and my blemishes fading. They didn’t go away completely, this was the first application. However, I can’t believe how fast this product started working.  The bottle is supper tiny and I was hesitant buying it because of how small it is but so glad I did.  I have tried a lot of spot treatments and nothing worked like this. Highly recommend. Literally worked instantly
