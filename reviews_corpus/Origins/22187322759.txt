I have normal-dry skin and this face wash is HG status. It doesnâ€™t irritate my crazy sensitive face or strip it of my natural oils. I always use a pea sized amount after double cleansing at night. In the mornings, I simply use warm water. I like the ingredients as well. I had my mom (50s) try it and she is hooked as well! nan
