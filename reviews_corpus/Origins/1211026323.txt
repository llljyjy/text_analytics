This toner is amazing!  I noticed right away how easy it was to use and how gentle it felt on my skin.  After using it for a few weeks, I saw a change in my skin which was more brighter and soothing.  There is a slight earthy smell because of the mushrooms but you get used to it.  I would definitely recommend giving this a try! Worked wonders on my skin!
