I think the moisturizer itself was very average - nothing in particular was wrong with it, but I did not think that I saw any benefits after using it for a few weeks. However, I could not tolerate the extremely strong herbal scent. The scent is so strong that I feel like I can’t use it during the daytime because I don’t want other people to think that I smell like medicinal herbs. If you can handle strong herbal/medicinal scents, then you might not mind using this moisturizer. It would be helpful to test the product in store first.Disclaimer: This product was provided to me as a sample for review. nan
