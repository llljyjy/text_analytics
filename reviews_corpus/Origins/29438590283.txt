I received this Mega Mushroom Relief & Resilience from BzzAgent for free for my honest opinion. Wow! This product is incredible and unique. I can’t believe how moisturize and hydrating it is and it’s a liquid. It’s very different type of lotion in liquid form. Never used something like this before. You can actually feel the hydration when applying. I really like how soothing it is and helps with redness. I have only used it a few times and already starting to see a difference. It’s not drying at all and absorbs quickly into the skin. A++ Wow!!
