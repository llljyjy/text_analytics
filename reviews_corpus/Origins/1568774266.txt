I have been using this wonderful lightweight gel moisturizer for years especially in summer when I like lighter textures that absorb immediately. Great for normal and combo skin, it is great for makeup prep and it leaves skin soft and hydrated and glowy without a heavy feeling. So refreshing! Lightweight hydration
