Origins Checks and Balances Frothy Face Wash has a silky creamy texture . It has a consistency that  feels like im using a facial cream mask  . It has a clean minty scent. When using this product I felt a slight uncomfortable tingling sensation that lasted for a few minutes . I did feel my skin was squeaky clean ,soft and I noticed my blemishes are starting to dry .It did not  wash off my make up as it claims. This face wash did not work out for me but it might be ok for others. Calms blemishes
