This product is definitely a let down. I’ve used Origins exclusively for nearly a decade now and the Zero Oil cleanser was the backbone of my skin care routine. I bought this thinking it was the same as the previous formulation since the packaging is the same but buyer beware. It’s a new formula. And honestly I don’t think it works as well as the mint saw palmetto one. It certainly smells worse, my skin doesn’t feel as clean and I’m finding it’s doing a worse job at keeping my skin happy. So I’m going to be looking elsewhere for my cleanser moving forward. 2 stars because it does meet the requirement of being a cleanser, just not a good one It's not the same as the old Mint and Saw Palmetto
