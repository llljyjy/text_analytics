The only pimples I’ve always gotten are big blind, painful pimples once every weeks on some part of my face. I started using this mask a few years ago (after trying a few other cheaper products and other brands) and the pimples have stopped. To this day, when I skip the masking by more than a week, I get a blind pimple. It doesn’t dry out my skin (I have sensitive and very dry skin). Always leaves me feeling fresh and bright skin. It has a beautiful light and natural scent. I’ve tried the cheaper tube version also by Origins - it did not work. This tub lasts me almost 4 months and is definitely worth every penny. 10 stars
