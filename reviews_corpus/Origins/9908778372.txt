I have mostly dry skin which means I don’t suffer from usual acne but I do have a big closed comedones problem. This mask helps purify it enough that I feel a difference with those pesky whiteheads but the honey helps keep my face hydrated. It’s the best of both worlds! Good for dry skin prone to whiteheads
