I have tried a few matte moisturizers ,and I don’t like the formula of this one. There are so many essential oils in here, so this is not fragrance free. The scent is a bit citrusy and sweet. It dries down like a dry shampoo. You apply it like a normal moisturizer and wait for the alcohol to evaporate for it to become matte. This is why it can be too dry for some people. It doesn’t pill under makeup which can be good to use as a mattifying primer or under sunscreen. It controls oil all day. I think this would be better in humid weather Too drying
