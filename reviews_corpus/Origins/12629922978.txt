As a huge fan of Origins, I was excited to receive the new Clear Improvement Pore Clearing Moisturizer! My face is always dry & can break out. When I first opened the container the smell of either Tea Tree or Eucalyptus hit my nose hard, however, it did not ruin the product enjoyment. The cream is cool to the touch & not too thick or thin. With continued use along with my skin cleansers, I saw a lovely improvement! Origins never really let me down and it or wonâ€™t let you down either! A must have!!!!
