This product definitely soothes as it claims! It’s easy to apply & comes in a great size bottle. You get a lot of product for your money. The downside is the smell, not that it’s bad. The smell is just super strong. It doesn’t linger which is great, but the smell did put me off a bit. Other than the smell, seems to be a good product. Soothing, but strong smell.
