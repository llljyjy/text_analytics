Second time this saved my skin! I used the ordinary 10% niacinamide / 1% zinc and it gave me a bad chemical burn and reaction. I used this for 3 days and it helped my skin so much. It is recommended to use on a cotton round but I put it on with my hands and pat in until it soaks all the way in. The smell is light, the consistency is like water & it leaves my skin somewhat luminous and hydrated. I follow up with my fave moisturizer and Iâ€™m good to go. The itchy and burning bumps are gone and I am left with a bit of scarring and some flaking but overall my skin is MUCH calmer and smoother after using this. I recommend this product to all my sensitive skin girls. Before is from 10/21 & after is from 10/24. Great for calming reactive skin
