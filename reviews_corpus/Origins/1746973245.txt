This is a great step before moisturizer anytime you need that extra moisture in your skin. Whenever I use a harsh mask, my face always feels tight, but when I use this product afterwards it helps with calming my skin. I took one star away because they are not cruelty free so I wont be purchasing anything from this company until that changes. Good
