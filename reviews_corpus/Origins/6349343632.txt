I like this face wash. The texture is very similar to Lancome mousse face wash. It feels creamy and comes a lot of foam. Still very easy to rinse off.  And I face doesn’t feel dry after using it. The smell is typical origins skincare smell, it’s like from the nature, doesn’t feel artificial a lot of foam and good smell
