This is a great product. I stopped using for a few years and recently rediscovered just how wonderful it is. I don’t use this on my cheeks or forehead, it’s a bit too intense for my sensitive skin, but works great on my chin and nose where I tend to have more oily, clogged pores and blackheads. It works like a dream to clear up those areas. I wouldn’t use this more than once a week, but my skin is on the dryer/sensitive side and my main skin issue is clogged pores, not acne. If that sounds like you, give it a shot. They’re also a great company to support. nan
