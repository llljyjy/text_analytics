It’s the consistency of a toner and it’s soothing and refreshing. I use a cotton round to apply. You don’t need to use a lot so be careful if applying with your fingers. I love that it has natural ingredients. Leaves my skin refreshed. I use this mostly at night but you can use in the AM as well. nan
