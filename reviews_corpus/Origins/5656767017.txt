This is my first go with the Ginzing collection and I’m pleasantly surprised. This is a true gel cream formula that absorbs into the skin without leaving a sticky residue. It leaves my skin nice and dewy but not greasy and wears well underneath makeup. The citrus smell is really light and I don’t find it to be irritating. Overall, a great moisturizer for oily/combo skin types. Leave My Skin Dewy & Bright!
