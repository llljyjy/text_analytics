i’ve tried all the other origins products and have worked for origins before at macys back in 2015. loved their masks but left before they released this one along with other recent releases. this mask feels so nice! doesn’t tug or dry out my skin and felt great after washing off. from what I can tell, this mask is a great alternative for drier skin because of the honey infused in it. the original clear improvement mask takes a while to dry down and cracks while this one does also dry down but almost stretches with your skin when you talk and move your face. both help detoxing the skin and for me, prevents acne/purges the skin. I have normal to oily skin but get dry in the winter. glad I got to try this mask! only knocked a star off because I haven’t tried it for very long to see any significant results nan
