This is probably the only mask Iâ€™ve tried after which I actually felt a difference in my skin. My skin was baby soft and much smoother after using this mask. It smells great and goes on very easily - also washes off nicely and is very comfortable on the face. Would Definitely recommend! LOVE THIS!
