I’ve used a handful of products by origins. The packaging on this product is very cute but looks bigger than the amount of product it actually holds. The smell isn’t too overpowering and it goes on smoothly. I did notice the first time I used it I had a little big of a tingling sensation. This product seems to be okay but after a couple uses it doesn’t seem like something I would repurchase Just Okay
