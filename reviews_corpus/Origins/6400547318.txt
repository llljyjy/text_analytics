Omg! This is the only face wash that I’ve used and it didn’t make my skin breakout. Absolutely love it. My skin feels super soft. The only thing is that this is not a makeup remover. Meaning you have to use some sort of solution to dissolve your makeup before or after using this. All and all I’m in love with this line. I also use their skin brightening and cream.. Love love love
