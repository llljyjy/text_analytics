This lotion is wonderful. I was skeptical when I heard it was primarily comprised of mushrooms and I was unsure of how it would smell. To my delight it smells wonderful almost like eucalyptus to me. It also helps reduce the redness from my rosacea and acne inflammation without making my face an oily mess! I donâ€™t know how I lived without it. Smells great and soothes!
