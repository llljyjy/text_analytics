I love the texture of this cleanser. It is originally very thick and creamy but with water it becomes a beautiful frothy texture that cleanses my skin perfectly. It is very gentle, cleaning and refreshing my skin without ever drying it out, causing irritation or stripping. The mint scent really shines with this wash but it is not overbearing and doesn’t linger for too long. It’s a very invigorating scent and the wash has been great at leaving my skin feeling fresh as well. Gentle Everyday Cleanser
