I really hate stuff with alot of chemicals, but this is different. It feels very natural and unique. The consistency is watery and feels refreshing when applied. At first I really though this was a lotion for your body lol. After reading the instructions I realized that you apply it to your face. Smells good and feels good on the skin. My skin is very sensitive, but this actually helped me look plump and firmer on my face. Definitely recommend for skin routine. Soothing and Refreshing
