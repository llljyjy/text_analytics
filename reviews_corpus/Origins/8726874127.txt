I got this as a sample with my recent one purchases. I am trying to venture outside of my Kate Somerville Exfolikate Cleanser and since this popped up in the beauty rewards, I thought why not.

It is very creamy and has a really pretty opal/pearl look, and smells like mint (not toothpaste, more like fresh mint leaves). So far I really love it! It takes care of my Nyx Epic Wear Liner (waterproof - if you know the struggle when it comes to removing this!) without any aggressive scrubbing or rubbing of my eyes. Once I finish the sample, Iâ€™m looking to get the full size (: fresh and hydrating
