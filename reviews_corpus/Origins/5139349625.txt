The Origins Clear Improvement Honey Mask is a nice mask that is very refreshing to the skin. My skin feels healthy and hydrated after using it and the smell is very nice. I will say that it can be a bit sticky and hard to wash off, probably because of the honey! I was hoping it would do more for my acne, but maybe Iâ€™ll get that benefit in time. Nice mask
