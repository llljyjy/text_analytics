Listen origins consistently impresses me and always delivers a quality product. I stopped using moisturizer a while ago because I felt it suffocated my face and gel creams weren’t for my oily acne prone skin but they somehow knew to make a matte version and it’s perfect. I am of dark complexion and it blends perfectly and delivers the right amount of moisture but doesn’t make me greasy. Love it
