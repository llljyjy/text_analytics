This eye cream feels really nice on my skin and absorbs well around the eye area without weighing it down. Do I notice a huge difference in my undereye circles? No. Not really. But does my skin feel better and possibly a little more plump? Definitely. So that in and of itself is really nice! I really like the feel of this cream but wish it had more obvious effects. Feels nice under the eye
