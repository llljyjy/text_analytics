Origins’ Ginzing Refreshing Eye Cream has a smooth, ultra soft, creamy texture. It does warm up your skin and gives you a youthful, warmer tint. I’m prone to eyes that water and become irritated when I wear eye makeup, but this felt cool and gave me no reaction, so I assume this is a very natural and high quality formula with good and effective ingredients . This product is working good for me so far. I would definitely recommend this product to my friend and buy more when I run out of this amazing eye cream! nan
