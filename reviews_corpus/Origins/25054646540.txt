So I recieved this product for testing purposes and the first thing that confused me was how it was actually a liquid consistency instead of a lotion consistency. However, it still applies well (and dries quickly) so you donâ€™t constantly feel like you are drenched in product. As far as results go, I actually suffer from mild rosacea and after using this product I see diminished redness in my cheeks which is a real game changer. Diminished Redness
