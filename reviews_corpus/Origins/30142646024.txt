I have both dry and acne prone skin , so this moisturizer is honestly a blessing in disguise. It helps prevent new breakouts while combatting my existing blemishes as well . It’s lightweight and it’s main key ingredients are charcoal , salicylic acid & witch hazel . I would recommend to anyone who has similar skin type as myself . multifunctional
