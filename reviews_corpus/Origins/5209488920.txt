I pat this on my face morning and night after cleansing (which is why I wish it weren’t as pricey as it is). It helps restore my skin’s pH immediately and feels so refreshing on my face and neck. If someone could recommend a cheaper option, I may consider switching. I don’t know for how much longer I can keep justifying the price... I usually can for products at this price point that last me 9 months+, but this one is maybe 4 or 5 months for how often I use it. am/pm reset
