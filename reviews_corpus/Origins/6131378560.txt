I look at this packaging and immediately think “GREEN” good for the earth and natural, which it is. This soothing treatment lotion reminds me of a toner because of how watery it is. It has an earthy scent to it. I absolutely loved how quick it absorbed into my skin and left it looking radiant (my skin needs it). Origins always has the best products!! nan
