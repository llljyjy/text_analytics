I have combination/oily skin and I’ve been applying this treatment lotion twice daily for a few weeks and I’m really enjoying it! Right out of the tall, recyclable bottle, is a  watery texture I apply directly to my clean hands and apply it to my freshly cleansed face. This toner lotion (more like liquid) absorbs quickly and does a fabulous job at hydrating and plumping my oily/combination skin. I have noticed a significant difference in my pores and uneven texture. With consistent use my skin now appears brighter, more even skin tone, while reducing redness almost immediately. I also struggle with clogged pores in my t-zone & I’ve experienced no issues while using this. It takes away excess oil, without drying me out. I highly recommend giving this product a try! Nice and Cooling Liquid Lotion!
