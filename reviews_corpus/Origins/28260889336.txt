I am honestly indifferent to this product. I don’t think it’s bad but it’s not outstanding either.I saw no difference when I used it.For context, it is water based so it’s a runny lotion (which as far as lotion texture goes, this is closer to water in texture than it is to lotion)I have a combination dry and oily skin which is also very sensitive. And while I did not have any allergic reactions to it, I also did not see any benefits. If this is important to contextualize, I’m black . Same skin shade as Taraji P Henson nan
