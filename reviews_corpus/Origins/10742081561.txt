I got this as a trial size sample, but had to come here to add my experience. It did leave my skin very smooth, I’ll give it that. However, I have been using some pretty heavy duty skin care lines and products since I was 12 (I’m 23 now) and have never ever had an issue with product just finding it’s way into my eye during regular use…until this stuff? As soon as I rinsed my face it felt like there was sand in both of my eyes. I thought little of that since the exfoliating particles did feel small and sand-like on my skin, thinking it would pass quickly with a little light rubbing. Wrong. It’s been half an hour since my nightly skincare routine; I’ve taken out my contacts and massaged with contact solution and still: sand in my eyes. I didn’t change anything about the mechanics of washing and rinsing my face. The only difference about tonight compared to the last ten years has been this product. Who knows maybe it was a fluke but I’m writing this in the hopes it takes a little of the sting out of my eyes, if only proverbially. Sandy Eyes?
