I have only used it a couple of times and I am already seeing a difference in my skin. But let me also warn you that it does have a burning or stinging effect in the beginning. I got worried at first but then I did some research and found it was normal for that to happen. It only lasts for a little bit and you don’t feel anything after that. It goes on like a nice smooth paste and you need to take it off with warm water as it doesn’t dry and peel off. I would totally recommend this to anyone trying to get clear skin. Great mask for clear skin
