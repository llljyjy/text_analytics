This seemed really promising - beautiful packaging, smells really nice, wonderful texture. I used this for 3 mornings in a row replacing my normal morning moisturizer + SPF combo. I broke out shortly after - it wasn’t a horrible breakout or anything, but not worth the pretty packaging! I wouldn’t purchase this, personally. Promising, but… breakout!
