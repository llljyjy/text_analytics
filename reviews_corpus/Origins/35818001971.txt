I’ll start with the fragrance first because I know that’s important to a lot of people. It has a good smell, but it can come off as a bit much if you don’t enjoy it, so it’s kind of a pro and a con.Now for the moisturizing effect, it worked really well on my T-zone. I’ve kept it solely for that area as it can be a bit drying on my normal/dry areas. For the price range and it’s limited use on my face, I find it to be a good value as it’ll last a long time only using it on my T-zone. Good moisturizer for dry skin
