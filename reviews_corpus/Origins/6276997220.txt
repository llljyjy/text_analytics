I really enjoyed this! I’ve been getting into essences lately and this was really great to try. It was really delicate on my skin and made it feel hydrated and left a nice base to put the rest of my skincare routine on. I would buy it again, especially since there’s a LOT of product in it! Hydrating, not greasy
