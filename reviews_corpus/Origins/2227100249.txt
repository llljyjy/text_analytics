I have dry skin and have been using this serum since beginning of April (NJ/NYC spring time climate and weather), it’s retained moisture well and the smell is like peeling open a clementine, very pleasant. It’s got a cooling sensation when it hits the skin so it’s very refreshing. I use with a toner and moisturizer. Refreshing and Hydrating
