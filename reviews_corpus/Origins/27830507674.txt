I received this complimentary from Origins for review. My main skincare goals in the morning are to feel more refreshed and awake. This gel cream is lightweight and hydrating, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It helps my skin look radiant and glowy and feels refreshing to apply. My skin stays hydrated all day and layers well with makeup. nan
