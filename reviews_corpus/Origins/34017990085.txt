If you are prone to sunburnt or red skin like me, (I live on the beach!) then this product is perfect for you!  Many other products burn my skin if it even has a tiny bit of sunburn.  This product allowed my skin to feel relief while using it.  This product has a fragrance, but itâ€™s not strong and strange like other lotions I have used on my face.  It left my face feeling soft, soothed, and with a glow!  I typically use this product before applying my face moisturizer.  It will allow your face moisturizer to glide on smoothly.  I use in the AM and PM for best results!  I definitely recommend this if you have textured or red skin, it helps sooth the bumps and redness! I LOVE THIS SOOTHING TREATMENT LOTION
