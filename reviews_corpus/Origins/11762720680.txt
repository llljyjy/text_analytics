I was on the hunt for a good moisturizer for my acne prone skin, I’ve been using this religiously for a month now and I’m surprised. It didn’t break me out. It has a very pleasant smell but light. Nothing to harsh. It’s very lightweight, sinks into your skin right away leaving you with a matte finish, surprising it’s very hydrating without the greasy feeling. It’s definitely one of the best Formulas I’ve tried this far. Just try it!
