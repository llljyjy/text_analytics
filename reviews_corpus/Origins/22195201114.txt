I love the results! I read some reviews about the scent and was concerned that I wouldn’t like it but I actually did like it! The only down side is that the product is a liquid and I found it a little challenging to apply it, you can’t really use the tip of the fingers so I used the palm of my hand and then applied to the face. Other than that everything is great! It did reduce the redness of my face, I feel that my skin has a film over it. Really like it! nan
