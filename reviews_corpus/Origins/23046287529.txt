I received this product a little over a week ago and it was my first time trying a product like this. In the past I have only used treatment lotions that specifically targeted acne. When I first tried this product I did not like it at all. The first issue was the expectation of a cream considering it is called a lotion, but this product is more like a toner. So now I have wasted a good portion of the product and it is all over my sink. Then this peppery scent hits me and I am not a fan at all. However, I push through the scent to test the product and the scent is subtle enough to be covered by the rest of your skincare regimen. After the first couple of days this product simply felt like a toner. The only benefit I noticed was the removal of leftover dirt, but I needed more based on the price. Then after a few more days I noticed a change. I have been dealing with dullness for MONTHS trying different products and nothing was working and if it did the effects lasted for only an hour. However, this combined with my current skincare routine left me hydrated and glowing ALL DAY. The other unexpected result was that I just so happened to be around the time of my monthly cycle where I usually have breakouts with huge painful pimples. This month there was nothing! This product is the only thing that I have changed. I was shocked as this has been something I have dealt with my whole life and always expected it to be a thing. I canâ€™t wait to continue to see how this product holds up especially in the drier months! nan
