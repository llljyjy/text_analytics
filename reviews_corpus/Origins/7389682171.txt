Loveeee the scent and texture. Not super hydrating so I think this moisturizer would be better suited for oily/combo skin rather than dry. I would also recommend using on this on days youâ€™re not wearing makeup. I find it a little difficult to layer under makeup. So definitely use it at night or makeup free days. The best scent!
