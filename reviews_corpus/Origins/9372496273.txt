When I first tried this product I didn’t really care for it (I tried it in the winter and the foam/frothy kind of freaked me out) but I’ve grown to really love this product-you don’t need a lot and my skin feels great after I use it. Would recommend especially in the summer. I saw some reviews on here that don’t recommend it because it made their eyes burn but it says on the packaging to avoid eyes and I’ve never had a problem. If wearing makeup I use a makeup remover then this. Grown to love this!
