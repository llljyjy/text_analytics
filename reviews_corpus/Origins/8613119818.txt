I have a dry skin and I have tone differences and redness on my face. I used the Mega-Mushroom Relief & Resilience Soothing Treatment Lotion with cotton pad like a toner twice a day. My skin looks so much smoother and the redness got better after using. The texture was surprisingly more liquid than a lotion, but it works well. I wish it would have a fresher, different scent. Overall, Iâ€™m really satisfied with this product. Soothing
