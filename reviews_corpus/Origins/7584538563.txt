I have combination skin thatâ€™s excessively dry in winter a d if I use anything with oil to combat this, somehow my face still manages to get shiny in places. So I was excited to try a matte moisturizer that still delivers intense hydration and reduces pores simultaneously. The Original Skin moisturizer is gel based and absorbs nicely into my skin with a light scent. I was happy to note that my skin felt moisturized and my nose and forehead were truly not shiny. This is a great primer for under makeup because of that. I really like this product and its price point. Shine reducing for combo skin
