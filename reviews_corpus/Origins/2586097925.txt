This was a great product. I have very sensitive skin and was impressed with how non-irritating this product was. It goes on nicely and has a pleasant smell. It dries down really well without being sticky or leaving any sort of residue feeling on your skin. Iâ€™ve only been using about a week, but have noticed that my skin looks more hydrated and my blemishes are less red. I apply after washing my face before I apply any of my other products and have been loving the results. This is a must buy! nan
