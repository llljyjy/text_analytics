I’ve used this product 2x and have noticed a difference in my skin, a few dark spots in my forehead and chin and lightened a bit. This is my first time using retinal and the only thing I did not was a little bit of dryness in the morning but other than that the color of the product didn’t bother me, looking forward to using it some more. nan
