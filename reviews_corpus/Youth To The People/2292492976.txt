I’ve been using this product, 6 days a week, for about a month now. My skin has a high tolerance for retinol, so I experienced no adverse reactions. So far I see no visible difference. I will likely not purchase again, mainly because of the price and because I can’t see what’s left in the bottle….so annoying. nan
