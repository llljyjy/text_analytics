I definitely think this new launch is worth trying! I have super dry skin, and this product just sinks right in, instantly leaving my skin feeling and looking hydrated. It has a unique smooth rich texture that’s super lightweight; and never leaves a greasy or sticky residue, instead it leaves my skin with a healthy natural-looking glow. I also notice that it makes my skin feel and look more firm and plump. So far I love using this moisturizer, and can’t wait to see what good it does for my skin! Perfect
