My rosacea cheeks and I moved back to colder weather this summer. The dryness and sensitivity is at an all time level of real now that I’m in my 30’s. When I’m not blotchy red, my skin appears quite dull and my forehead doesn’t conceal horizontal lines. Then I discovered hyaluronic acid. It’s my go-to skincare ingredient and this product delivers it. Goes on smooth with a slight stick that I expect from hyaluronic acid products. No pilling for me. It definitely works best in tandem with a moisturizer (I use YTTP Superfood Air Whip Moisture Cream which is also formulated with hyaluronic acid). It is almost scent-less, in my opinion, so you don’t have to worry about an overly floral or woodsy smell soaking into your pores. I do give 4/5 stars because I have had other hyaluronic acid serums that on there own act as an instant Botox, erasing my forehead dryness. This one isn’t quite that level of hydrating WOW but when in combo with the YTTP moisturizer, it’s pretty freakin close!I received this as a sample in exchange for my honest review. nan
