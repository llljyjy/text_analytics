This is what my nighttime routine was missing!!! This serum is amazing and helps my skin breathe better throughout the night. I don’t wake up with a “tired” face anymore and it’s been so evident this retinal+niacinamide serum is helping me feel this way. This does leave a goldish tint for a minute or two as it’s absorbing, but it’s just the product doing it’s job. Easy 5 stars for me! Just magical!
