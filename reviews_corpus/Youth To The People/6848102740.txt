I started using this toner in May and it had worked very well. Nice, gentle exfoliation that made my sensitive skin happy. Hence the 2 star rating instead of 1. Unfortunately, like many others reviews I noticed a few days ago that it’s growing junk in it. This was not there before and is definitely not product separation. If it were product separation it would “dissolve” back into the liquid once shaken/ stirred and it does not. I am so disappointed since I have to throw away most of the bottle now. Don’t waste your money! Worked well until it spoiled
