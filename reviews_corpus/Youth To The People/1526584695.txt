Wow! This is a holy grail product for me. Every time I use this I get compliments on my skin. I swear it makes my skin look as good as my three year old nephews.The product is pretty gentle as long as you don’t use anything harsh like retinols within 24 hours. If you have sensitive skin just get your face wet first and work up to three minutes. It also helps to remove in circular motions to get a little extra exfoliation. My skin is sensitive and will typically be red for about 30 minutes after, but that can easily be covered by skin tint. Besides the smooth texture this gives my face, I believe it makes my other products work harder by allowing them to penetrate my skin. I can’t live without this product and can’t wait to try more YTTP. Wow! Holy grail
