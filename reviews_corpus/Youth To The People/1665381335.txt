I really like the serum; it is lightweight and absorbs really well. Feels nice on my skin and does well under makeup. I have dry skin and I do feel it gives me an extra boost of hydration. I took one star off because the pump is the absolute worst. It sticks, making the product shoot everywhere when it does come out and giving less control over how much you get. I would prefer a dropper style top over the crappy pump. nan
