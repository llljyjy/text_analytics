I read a few reviews saying how “crumbly” the formula was, and I find myself a bit confused! The formula is like butter or coconut oil—if it’s cold, it’s going to be harder. Once you put some in the palm of your hand or allow the heat of your hand to warm it up, it’s such a dream. I don’t wear a full face of makeup and prefer a more natural look, so for me, this does a perfect job of melting off sunscreen, tinted oil, brows, and mascara. If you prefer a more full-coverage look, I cannot attest to that (but this is intended as the first step of a double-cleanse anyway). I think it’s a great deal for the price as a little goes a long way—and it’s super satisfying to rinse off to a milky consistency. I’m a huge fan of YTTP in general, but this has easily become one of my favorite products. A melty, buttery dream
