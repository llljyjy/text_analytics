This is the best retinol product I’ve tried! I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin, to the point where every time I had previously used retinol I’d have to spend weeks trying to heal my skin barrier again. I was a little dubious at first because of my past experiences(and the fact that it’s really yellow) but I’ve been using it for about three weeks and my skin has never looked better! I suffered from a lot of texture and big pores and now both are seemingly gone. 100000% going to purchase until I die Too good
