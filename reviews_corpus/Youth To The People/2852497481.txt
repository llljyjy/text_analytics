I wanted to try this product due to the amazing reviews but I deemed it was just not for me.  I used it as step 1 for double-cleaning (when I have make-up on) and although it left my face clean and smooth feeling after immediate use, I would wake up with 1 or 2 pimples on face.  I tried this two more times since I really wanted to like it (and wishful thinking it was a one-off) but still got pimples the next day. Not What I Thought
