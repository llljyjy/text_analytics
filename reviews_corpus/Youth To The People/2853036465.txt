This is a decadent moisturizer ($$) but a little goes a very long way. My very dry reactive skin loves the soothing feel of this moisturizer and I’m so happy with the results.

But I love being extra with moisturizers and this in my top 3 for winter in New England (Biossance and Kiehls). A Favorite Soothing Moisturizer for Dry Months
