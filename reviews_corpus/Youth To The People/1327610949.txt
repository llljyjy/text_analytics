I saw the reviews about this product drying up so I waited a few months before writing mine. I bought mine in November (now Feb) and it’s still going on strong. A little goes a long way. I use YTTP Spinach and Kale HA moisturizer all over my face, then a few thin dabs of Dream Eye Cream under and around the corner of my eyes. I don’t have much eye wrinkles so not sure how much it’s helping but I do find it very hydrating and feels nice to put on. nan
