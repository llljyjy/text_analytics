My skin feels softer and more supple after I wash,  which hasn’t happened since the first time I used Dr. Brandt back in the day.  Other cleansers left my skin feeling stripped, like sure they cleaned my skin,  but didn’t provide any protection or nutrients.   I am so glad I tried this cleanser. I will continue to use it. So Glad I Tried It
