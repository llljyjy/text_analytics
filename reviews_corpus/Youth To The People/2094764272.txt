This serum is so creamy rich I just don’t know where to begin.  Some serums can seem to oily or watery …and my face gets red and sweaty looking after- this serum takes it to a new and improved level.  After 6 days my skin appeared firmer and was glowing!  The consistency is perfection.  I really am enjoying this and I use a tiny amount and it goes along way! Love Me Some Se-Rum
