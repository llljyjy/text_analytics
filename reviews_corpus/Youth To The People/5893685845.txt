I had been using retinol already so I didn’t have to work up to using this one and I had no reactions which was great. The very yellow color left the slightest tint but rubs in and more importantly, didn’t rub off on pillows or anything. So far I’m loving this and I feel it’s making a different in my skin’s appearance. I recommend giving it a try! nan
