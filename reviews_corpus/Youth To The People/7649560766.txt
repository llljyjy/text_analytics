Love this stuff. I’ve been looking for an acid-free vitamin c serum for my acne scarring that wouldn’t react with my topical acne medication (tactupump). Although I had to pay a little bit more, I love what this is doing for my skin. It’s been a couple of weeks and I can already see that my face is brighter and more radiant. Great vitamin C option for sensitized skin!
