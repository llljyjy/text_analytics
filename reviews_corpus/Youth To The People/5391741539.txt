I live in a super dry climate, and am constantly looking for a face oil that with lock in moisture and give me a healthy glow. This oil is lightweight but also extremely hydrating. I apply it in the morning and give it 20-30 mins to absorb before applying my makeup, and then apply again at night. Huge fan. Will repurchase. Low-key MVP.
