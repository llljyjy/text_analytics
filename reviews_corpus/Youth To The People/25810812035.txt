Not the best but not the worst. The packaging is cute, and vibes are great but as a product that is marketed towards dry skin, it is very mediocre. The moisturizing effects is only there right after you apply it. Itâ€™s a good product if you wanna splurge on something, but overall not worth it. not the worst but definitely not the best
