I have super sensitive skin so I patched tested on one side of my face. After two weeks (used twice a week), I was able tell the difference from the area I had applied it to versus the rest of my face very clearly! I had some texture and it completely went away. The yellow tint goes away and it has zero scent. Although itâ€™s kinda pricey a little goes away! I will for sure pick up a full size. 10/10 recommend
