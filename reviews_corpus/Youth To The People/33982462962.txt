Love the smell and the formula, however, I had an allergic reaction 10 days in after I started using it. It caused small red blotches on my skin and a few small  bumps. I knew it had been this cleanser since I wasn’t using any other product. Otherwise this seems like a great product, it just wasn’t for me. nan
