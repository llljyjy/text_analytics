Holy grail! It takes a few days to fully grasp how to use it properly. But once you’re comfortable with the formula, it’s just awesome. I’ve been struggling with acne and dull skin for many years and it’s really the first cleanser that made such a difference. I use it alone when I don’t wear makeup and as a first cleanser to dissolve makeup. My skin is just glowing. No new breakouts and no drying. The best cleanser in my life
