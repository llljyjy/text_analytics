I like this sleeping mask. it’s got a nice scent, feels gentle, and does make my skin feel deeply moisturized when I wake up. for me, though, it’s just too expensive. even though a little goes a long way, it’s still not enough product to make it worth the price for me. but if price isn’t an issue for you and you have dry skin, I do recommend this mask. works well, but expensive
