This product is just okay. I have sensitive, combo, acne prone skin. This hasn’t made my breakouts worse but it doesn’t make anything better. I like the Inkey List’s squalene oil better as a nighttime oil. This is pretty light and absorbs quickly. No strong scent. It’s not a bad product, but there are better oils for way less money. Not worth the money
