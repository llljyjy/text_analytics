I have sensitive and dry skin that becomes SUPER dehydrated in the winter, and this was the only product that kept my skin moisturized and supple all night (and day-- I used this in the morning before sunscreen as a moisturizer sometimes). Sure, it’s pricey, but it’s definitely worth it. My skin is so dry that hardly anything works on it and balances it out, and this did the trick!! Love their sustainable and low-waste mission as well. Great product all around if you ask me :) Dry skin lifesaver!
