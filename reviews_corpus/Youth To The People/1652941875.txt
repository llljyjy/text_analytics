I completely love this brand and was excited to try this new peptide cream, but it didn’t really do it for me. Overall, I think it’s a fine moisturizer, but the pricing doesn’t match up to the product in my opinion. I haven’t noticed any significant results in the last few weeks, so maybe it’s a slow burn, but I don’t think I’d pay the retail price long term to find out. Just “fine”
