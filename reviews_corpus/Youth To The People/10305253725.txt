I’m a swim instructor so I literally am constantly in drying chlorine. I love using this to bring some moisture and life back to my face. I put it on like a moisturizer at night a very thin layer and sleep with it the next day I wash it off and my skin looks amazing. Feels amazing and doesn’t leave any tacky ness once it’s washed off! When worn lightly on the face at night it feels somewhat tacky which is why a thin layer is better (trial and error…too much was too much). Can notice a difference when I don’t wear it and my skin is super dry! I WORK IN A POOL. THIS WORKS WONDERS.
