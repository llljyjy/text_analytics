Love love love ! I received this product along others picked to see how our skin responses to this serum and our intake on it and let me tell you, I have a very sensitive, normal-dry skin type and this has not once irritated my skin. I use it along with the oasis serum to also make sure my skin is prepped and hydrated before using this product, and I think that has helped it improve more! I use it ( 2x a week at night ) because that’s what best works for me. Youth to the People have not disappointed me once and I’m so happy they have came out with this! Gives you fast results without any irritation and keeps your barrier healthy which is the key to clear skin. It’s soo good ! and worth the money :) Great for my sensitive skin luvs !
