I’ve been using this serum every 2-3 nights for the last couple weeks and I loveeee it. My skin is used to retinol/al already, but this is so gentle that I’m sure most anyone could use it and see the benefits. It spreads well and absorbs immediately. I have a feeling this will become a permanent go-to for me ✨ YTTP never disappoints
