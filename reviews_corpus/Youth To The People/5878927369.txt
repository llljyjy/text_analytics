I absolutely love how soft my face feels after cleansing. A big plus that they use natural products. I decided to start investing more in skin care because I do care a lot about my face and skin of course, so I am so happy I chose this cleanser. I did so much research for 2 weeks before I bought it and its more than worth it. I have found my holy grail cleanser!
