No matter what you do, just know when you buy this and run out and get the feeling of wanting to try a new face wash then you buy a new face wash and think to yourself why did I change my face wash YTP was so great and did it’s job then you’ll tell yourself I’ll finish this one and then repurchase YTP then a month goes by and you’ll be so upset that your new face wash won’t finish faster because you miss YTP face wash so you decide to just re buy it and throw out the face wash you wanted to try out, so long story short you may not notice a difference you may not get clear skin overnight using this but this does the job for all types of skin and does not cause breakouts, it’s universal everyone loves it just don’t stray away stay faithful and loyal to this because you’ll miss it when you don’t have it.
