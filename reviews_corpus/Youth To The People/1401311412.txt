An excellent lightweight moisturizer for daily use. For drier, mature skin like mine this is better paired with a serum. No strong smell at all. Absorbs quickly into the skin. Reduces the appearance of fine lines and dry patches  Again, for those of us with drier skin, nothing beats the YTTP dream mask for nighttime use, but this is a good option for more humid summer days. Another solid product from YTTP. Lightweight moisturizer for normal or oilier skin.
