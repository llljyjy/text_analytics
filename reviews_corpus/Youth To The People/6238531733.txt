I have been using YTTP for about 2 years. This cream is amazing. It’s thin but not too thin. I feel like this cream is in-between Adaptogen superfood. I do feel that this cream has been hydrating my face and also we all love ceramides I have acne prone and sensitive skin and this cream does not irritate me. I do also like that it reduces the look of fine lines and firm skin this Cream also leaves your face feeling fresh not greasy not slimy but fresh I highly recommend it and I can’t wait to purchase it we all want youthful skin
