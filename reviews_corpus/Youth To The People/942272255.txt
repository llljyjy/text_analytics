Love this cleanser! It smells lovely and leaves my skin truly clean without stripping or drying; it also lathers really nicely, which isn’t always a guarantee with clean products. I’m 48 with sensitive skin (touches of rosacea), and this feels incredibly soothing. I also love the packaging: The bottle is glass, and one pump is the perfect amount. Calming Cleanser
