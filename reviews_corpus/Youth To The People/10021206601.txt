i’ve tried everything. from drugstore cleansers, switching up my skin care routine numerous times, even home remedies to get my oily and acne prone skin under control. i bought the mini pack along with the moisturizer and vitamin c serum and i’m still in disbelief. my acne is basically gone and my face finally feels smooth. im still dealing with hyperpigmentation from post acne marks but i’ve never thought i’d see the day where i could touch my cheeks & chin and not feel a single acne bump. the refill size has already been purchased! just remember to be consistent and patient! game changer for oily skin
