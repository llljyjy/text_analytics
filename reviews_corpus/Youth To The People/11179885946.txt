There’s something wrong with the mini version, the one I received was only ~30% filled and a super dark brown color. It seems like the seal is not glued properly and so a lot of the moisture evaporated. From what I’ve seen of other reviews this has been happening for a while - I would not recommend buying it until they get rid of this batch. I did return it in store and bought a full size instead (they didn’t have the mini size in store) and the checkout person was shocked at the condition of it.Product itself is wonderful. It has an interesting texture where it doesn’t feel thick but is very hydrating and works well even in the cold winters of Toronto. A little goes a long way. But it does break me out around my T zone, so I use a much lighter moisturizer overall and apply this around my cheeks and dryer spots. It’s always super hydrated and looks/feels great the next morning. Something is wrong w/ the mini version
