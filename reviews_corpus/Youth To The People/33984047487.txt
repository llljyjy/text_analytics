I absolutely love this. This sinks into your skin the moment you apply it. It doesn’t sit on top of your skin, making you feel like it would rub off on your pillowcase in two seconds. No irritation, stinging, or redness at all. After a couple weeks of using this, I feel the texture of my skin is less rigid. My acne scars have faded and become less apparent. Don’t let the yellow tint scare you!
