Any retinol, or in this case retinal, product takes a while before you can see significant change in your skin. So far I like it though because my skin doesn’t freak out if I use it a few days in a row! It also absorbs very well, doesn’t cause any negative reactions, and doesn’t leave me feeling super dry. can’t wait to see long term results!
