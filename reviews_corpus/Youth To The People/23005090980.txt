Not a fan of this product. I tried it because I like the moisturizers by this brand, but this cleanser isn’t comparable. It foams up quite a lot, and has a strong fragrance. It makes my skin feel dry and tight, and I got a couple pimples and small bumps on my face after using it for 2 days. I don’t have sensitive or dry skin. There are much better cleansers available by Shani Darden or iS Clinical. Those are my go-to but I wanted to try something new. Not a great product
