I got this mask in the Dreamer set and it’s the standout item for me! If you have dry, sensitive skin I feel this could really work for you. Almost all moisturizers and creams leave my skin feeling tight afterwards and I have to layer on an oil just for my skin to feel comfortable -- but this one feels so moisturizing yet lightweight after sinking in, and I don’t need an oil... I’m shocked at how perfect it is for me, it’s like sorcery?? I avoid fragranced products because they irritate my skin, but this one doesn’t. The scent is lovely and pleasant. Again, sorcery. The effects are also very good, brightens and smooths my skin!! I’m only bummed about the price, but overall I’m willing to make the investment for my skin to be as happy as it is. Must-try for dry skin!
