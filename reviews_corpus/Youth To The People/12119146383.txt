I bought this having really high hopes. It’s okay as a cleanser, particularly in the morning when I’m washing off what I applied the night before. However, I found that this didn’t remove my makeup very well. So, I’m keeping it, and I still use it now and then, but once the bottle is empty I likely won’t repurchase. Just my personal experience, though. It’s okay! Definitely not bad.
