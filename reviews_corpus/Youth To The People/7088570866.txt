I fell in love with this product immediately after feeling it. I have super dry skin and look for hydrating serums but the formulas with others that I’ve tried just didn’t hit it all the way and seemed like something was missing. I’ve finally found a combo that works for me and this brand is amazing. I like to go in with my skincare while my skin is still damp; I spray my toner on damp skin and go in with my Dermalogica Circular hydration serum and follow up with this product- really working it on my skin and immediately you will notice the difference. I follow up with the YTTP Superberry oil and then my moisturizer. Your skin will be hydrated and radiant and prepped for makeup! Highly recommend! My dry skin thanks me
