I used this product for about a month, 1-2x a week and it definitely leaves your skin feeling super hydrated and smooth. It doesn’t have a nasty scent and it applies to your skin like butter! The texture of the mask was really nice. The only downside of this product was that it made my face a little bit itchy whenever I applied it. I don’t necessarily have an extremely sensitive skin, it’s more on the mild side, but for this reason I stopped using it. It reminds me of the Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting Mask, which is my favorite mask of all time, and it’s very gentle on my skin. Good but not my fav
