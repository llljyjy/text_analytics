I love it. My first yttp moisture - although I do use the Retinol too, which I really like - and my skin just feels so soft and doughy. I may slowly be switching my entire skincare to them at this rate! Fine lines look much softer and rounded, rather than harsh and sharp, which really does a great job of getting rid of them in photos. Two weeks in and Iâ€™ll impressed already. nan
