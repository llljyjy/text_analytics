I have fairly sensitive dry skin and this product is semi-hydrating and makes you glow. I can’t believe how much I noticed a difference in my skin in just a few days. I have noticed that my skin is brighter, glowing and clear. I cannot recommend this enough. Perhaps not the greatest for the most sensitive types, as the Vitamin C content is quite high and there is a bit of a fragrance. With that said, I purchased a bottle after using the 100-point gift. I can’t get enough of this fantastic serum. This stuff works!
