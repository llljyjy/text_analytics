Shelf stable is a must for me! I have combo skin, redness from rosacea, mild adult acne, and VERY sensitive skin. My skin drinks this up and instantly looks brighter and more awake. It doesn’t pill with other skincare steps. I’ve gone through 2 bottles and will definitely be back for more! My Favourite!
