I was gifted a sample of this product for free to try out and give a review. I love the superfood moisturizer, and was thinking this would be a much thicker, richer application. It surprisingly has a light, bouncy quality that my skin really enjoys. I usually apply on damp skin, and it visibly has helped with my fine lines over the past week and a half of regular use. I will probably buy a full size for the winter, or after I exhaust my stock of superfoods... nan
