It’s okay as a cleansing balm but I didn’t care for the weird earthy/factory-like smell. I’m also kind of disappointed that it didn’t come with a spatula, especially for the price. I much prefer the one from then i met you but that’s just a personal choice. It’s also kind of hard to scrape out with my finger so I just wish it was made a little bit softer. It does emulsify and wash off just fine just not a fan. Meh
