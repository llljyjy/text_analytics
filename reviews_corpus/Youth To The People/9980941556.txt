I have normal to combination skin. I use this cleanser and the air whip moisturizer at night. It has made an incredible difference in my skin and does not leave it feeling stripped or compromised like other cleansers do. It’s also a good price for the amount of product you get since you only use a very tiny amount. I will repurchase this cleanser for as long as it’s available! Best cleanser ever
