We appreciate you sharing your concerns about the Superfood Unity Exfoliant. We are actively looking into variations in the clarity of the formula.  We can confirm that all safety testing, including micro testing, is currently passing and the salicylic acid is not crystallizing.  We have concluded that there are no safety concerns or diminished effectiveness due to these occurrences.  The separation is due to the active nature of our superfood blend in the product.“that is not separation. something is GROWING.their lack of concern makes me question all of their products lol. grow much?
