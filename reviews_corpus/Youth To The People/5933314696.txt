This product works really well. I noticed a definite improvement in my skin’s radiance as well as fading of my acne scars after just a few weeks. I use one-and-a-quarter pumps every morning and the bottle lasts about 3-4 months. It’s expensive, but it is very effective and is a zero waste product. Love it
