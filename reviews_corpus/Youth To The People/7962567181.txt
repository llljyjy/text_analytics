This past year I have tried out 4 different moisturizers (YTTP Future Cream, FAB Ultra Repair Firming Collagen cream, Laneige Water Bank Moisture cream and FAB Coconut water cream). The YTTP Future cream has been my favorite and here is why:My skin is on the drier side. I used this moisturizer in the day after I washed my face and before I applied my make up and loved the way it gave me a nice dewy look without making my skin feel oily. I also used it at night and I think it really helped preserve my skin barrier. I tend to break out during that time of the month and I believe this helped keep the break outs to a minimum and afterwards allowed my skin to heal faster. It is a pricier product but I plan on purchasing the polypeptide-121 future cream again. Probably my favorite moisture creamâ€¦ EVER!
