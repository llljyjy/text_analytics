Here’s the thing, I purchased this previously, received a regular full jar of smooth, light-colored, lovely moisturizer and absolutely enjoyed it. I purchased it again recently and I got what looks like an error, and it appears that several other reviewers have this issue as well: it’s a half-full jar of a dark, thick goop (see image). I don’t feel comfortable putting this on my skin and I’m miffed that there isn’t some kind of quality control in place that either pulls these out of the line OR at least if they would send me a note that says, “hey, this is more concentrated, it’s still safe to use, we know it looks weird but we’re not into waste, etc.” Something at least! I hate to waste $18 but I really loved the moisturizer I got before and I’m hopeful I can receive it again. love this moisturizer, hate that there’s no QC
