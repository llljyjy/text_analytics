I really, really like this serum.  This is the first hydrating serum that I’ve purchased because my skin is oily and suuuper prone to breakouts.  Because of my skin type I usually stick to exfoliating serums, retinol, and vitamin C serums in my skincare routine, but now that I’m in my mid 30’s I find that although my skin still gets oily, it tends to feel dehydrated and pores and wrinkles are becoming more prevalent.  So I picked this up and I really think it’s making a difference.  It’s very soothing and I love the texture; it’s not oily whatsoever and it alleviates redness and dullness, and I can feel it plumping up my skin.  Since I’ve been using it my pores aren’t as noticeable and I’ve also noticed that I don’t get nearly as oily throughout the day.  I haven’t noticed a huge difference in wrinkles yet but my skin does look smoother, more even, and more youthful.  I also appreciate that it doesn’t pill underneath my other serums, moisturizer, and makeup.  It’s a bit pricey imo, but I’m willing to pay a little bit more for a product that truly does what it promises to do.  And as someone who struggles to find hydrating skincare products that don’t contain oil or make me break out with clean nourishing ingredients, I’ll shell out the extra cash every time.  I highly recommend this product for anyone prone to breakouts or those with oily skin who are looking for a high quality, non comedogenic anti-aging serum. 10/10 Great anti-aging serum for oily, acne prone skin
