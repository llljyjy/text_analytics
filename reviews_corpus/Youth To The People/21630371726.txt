I’ve been using this mask as my nightly moisturizer for about a week and a half now and I’ve been hooked since the first time I opened the jar! It’s rich and creamy but soaks into my skin nicely so I don’t feel like I have a film on my face. I’ve been waking up with my skin just feeling good- not just to the touch but just passively feeling good. I’m really surprised with how much it’s evened out my complexion in such a short amount of time. new forever product!
