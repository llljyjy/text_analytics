I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review. After 4 weeks of using this super hydrating serum I could say it will continue being a classic staple in my skin care regimen! It’s packed with peptides, four molecular weights of hyaluronic acid and honestly I can’t live without it! Great underneath makeup and doesn’t feel heavy on the skin! Most hydrating serum!
