At first I hated it. Got it during winter; It left residue on my face after washing off. Was hard to emulsify. Had to use a second cleanser to completely wash off. I think my bathroom was too cold and maybe made it harder to wash off? Idk. Tried using it again now during summer. Been about 100 degree weather. And itâ€™s easier to use and rub on my face. And had no residue on my face? Weird I know. But i like it now lol. Removes makeup and my face feels clean w/out having to use second cleanser nan
