Really like how well it absorbs into the skin. I’ve been using it for about 2 weeks and skin does feel bouncier than before. Only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because I already use a lot of the YTTP products and my skin is soooo much better hydrated since then, so can’t tell how much more this serum alone is contributing. Will definitely keep using it! nan
