This moisturizer is perfect for me - not too thick, not too thin. My face feels perfectly hydrated with just a tiny amount of product. It hasn’t seemed to clog my pores (which is an issue I’ve run into with other brands’ moisturizers), yet really seems to soften my fine lines and give a youthful glow. 10/10 YTTP has done it again!
