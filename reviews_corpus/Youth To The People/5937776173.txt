I have very sensitive skin and usually never use acids. This product is so safe to use and never broke me out. In fact, it helped me clear my skin and gradually helped with leftover scarring. I use it every other night in combination with a 0.25% retinol on other nights. This is really a holy grail for those that need something light and gentle on their skin to help make your skin look clearer :). Please give this a try! Holy grail for sensitive skin types
