I’ve been using this every morning for a few weeks and I’m unfortunately... completely in love with it. I say unfortunately because the price point is quite painful, but since it’s taking the place of 3 other serums I used to use, I guess can’t be too upset. I apply one pump to my whole face and one extra small drop concentrated around the under eye for better de-puffing power. Use conservatively and let the product dry AND set completely before layering any other products and it won’t peel/pile as others have mentioned. Applied this way, it’s super soothing, hydrating and makes everything applied after feel light as a feather on my face. It really does feel like it’s creating a protective barrier, especially for me living in a very dry climate. I really do love this serum, just had to knock a star off for the steep price point and somewhat annoying learning curve to avoid piling. A little goes a long way!
