I have been struggling with very dry skin on my forehead and cheeks over the past year or so. After using this stuff once, I saw noticeable improvement with my skin texture. One month of using this once a week, without changing anything else in my skincare routine, and holy cow. I feel like I have a whole new face. This didn’t exasperate dryness, didn’t irritate my eczema, and didn’t feel too rough on my skin. Love this stuff and will repurchase. will keep in my skincare routine!
