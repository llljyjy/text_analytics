This is an excellent and soothing moisturizer. It is somewhere between the whipped supergreens on and the thick adaptogen cream. While I havenâ€™t used it long enough to know if it strengthening and firming my skin, I have noticed a better level of both hydration and moisturization which are hard to achieve during the sunny, dry summer. I will continue to use this until I finish the sample to comment on the claims of rejuvination. Excellent Moisturizer, bold claims need more time
