I’ve been using this serum for a while now, but my newest bottle is just off. They’ve done something to the formula. It pills horribly now and doesn’t sink into the skin like it used to. I hate that they’ve changed the formula because I finally thought I’d found a vitamin c that I loved. Back to looking for another one! new formula is horrible
