I saw this product on tiktok along with tons of good reviews and I really wanted it to work for me but it didn’t. It smells so good and made my skin feel soft. I’ve struggled with acne for years and even was on pills for it. My skin was almost cleared up and I didn’t have super bad breakouts to the point where I stopped taking meds for it. After using this cleaner all my acne from years ago came back within 2 weeks. I had the worse breakout and even switching back to my old cleaner I’m still dealing with the acne and whiteheads a month later that started with this cleaner. I’m back on my pills and it really stinks because now it feels like I’m back at square one with trying to clear up my skin. I don’t recommend this cleaner if you have/had acne. Save your money. horrible breakouts
