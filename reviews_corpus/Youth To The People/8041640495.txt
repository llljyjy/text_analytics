I started using the product once a week as recommended, and later moved onto using it every other night. I have sensitive skin, and it has caused no irritation. I do think it has helped smooth out my skin a bit, but I haven’t seen any drastic improvements with redness/ scarring. On the info card, it did say it will take multiple weeks to see change, so I will continue to use every other night and see if there are any improvements in my skin. But as of now, there weren’t any crazy results Give it time
