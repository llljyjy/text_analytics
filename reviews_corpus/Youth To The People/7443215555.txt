I’m very new to retinols (and retinals) but I must say, this is a great product! I’ve only used it a few times because I’m trying to find a good balance between this and exfoliating products, but I can still tell that my skin is hydrated, smoother, and brighter! I will definitely keep this in my regular rotation. Pleasantly Surprised
