I have mixed feelings about this cleanser. It’s very aesthetically pleasing (love the glass bottle, the fresh smell, the color and the healthy sounding name) When it comes to the actual product I was underwhelmed. I think it’s mostly because I prefer more of a foaming aspect in a cleanser, and this one hardly foams at all. My face just doesn’t have that clean feeling after which is important to me. Luckily I only purchased a travel size I wanted to love it
