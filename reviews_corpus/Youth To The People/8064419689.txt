I subbed this moisturizer in for my beloved air whip because I wanted to see how they would compare. I purchased full price, no incentives. So far, I am really liking it. The consistency is great, not too heavy, even on mega humid days. I have rosacea that is managed pretty well and there is no irritation. I do feel some tightening after application when combined with my sunscreen which is another plus (that they play well together). I am not sure how much itâ€™s going to help with my loss of firmness, but time will tell! Like just as much as Air Whip!
