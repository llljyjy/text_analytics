This is my first youth to the people purchase. I have used this serum for several weeks under my moisturizer and face oil and I’m really underwhelmed by it. I have really dry skin and need a bit of hydration under my moisturizer but I don’t feel like this adds anything. It doesn’t smell bad or irritate my skin which is nice. I will finish the bottle but don’t plan to repurchase. Not very hydrating
