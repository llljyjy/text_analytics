YTTP purports to care about the climate, first and foremost, of all its declarative values (see screenshot of their website), yet they waste extra packaging to make their tiny products fit into oversized boxes, making the product appear larger than it is. even worse, the brand new jar which is supposed to hold .25 oz is 1/3 full! here’s a comparison of their jar with another company’s product that has .16 oz of product and is way more. i will no longer buy anything from YTTP. they lost my trust and respect. New jar is 1/3 full
