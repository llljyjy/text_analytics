I love YTTP and was so excited to try this cleanser - it claims to be for all skin types but I have dry skin and as soon as I towel-dried my face off my skin basically started cracking. It left me sooooo dry that I had to loooooad up on moisturizer. Ended up using it a few times before returning. Sad :( Not For Dry Skin!!!
