I’ve been using this for about 2 ½ weeks and have loved it so far! I loved the previous formula but I did notice it left my skin tacky/sticky feeling and sometimes I’d have to wash it off and start over. I just thought it was my skin, but with the improved formula I noticed immediately how it was NOT sticky/tacky at all. I love using this in a basic routine of Superfood Cleanser, Exfoliant, Adaptagen moisturizer & Dream Oil. I haven’t had any irritation, redness or any other reactions. I’d recommend this to most skin types, the % of the acids is the perfect amount. I dont experience any stinging or tingling, its not tight feeling or squeaky clean feeling at all. It didn’t make my skin feel dry either, which is usually my biggest reason for choosing one exfoliant over another. Overall, my skin feels softer & looks more even toned, the redness has faded & it looks bright & healthy. No stickiness, more even skin tone
