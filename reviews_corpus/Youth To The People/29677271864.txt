This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. My skin is so sensitive and I have a really hard time finding products I can use and have wasted so much money trying different products out but I’m so glad I tried this. I’ve been using it for a year, and the condition of my skin has gotten so much better after using this stuff. I definitely recommend it especially for people that have sensitive dry skin. Also the Youth To The People superberry mask is one of my favorite products as well. You just use it as a moisturizer at night time and your skin will look AMAZING in the morning LOVE This Stuff
