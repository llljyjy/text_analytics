My first time trying this brand and these products, and I’ve been using them almost a week now. Quality-wise I think this is really great - my skin is super dry normally, and I can tell these products are starting to work on it but they’re pretty mild (which is good, and what I’d expect from a vegan product like this one).I appreciate that the company is vegan and cruelty-free, and the packaging is pretty minimal and recyclable/reusable. Their website has a lot of info about their social/environmental responsibility efforts and they’ve put some thought into repurposing and recycling the packaging with instagram campaigns and stuff. I think that’s awesome but I wish there was more they could do in that regard.The only negative thing I have to say right now, and why I didn’t give 5 stars, is that the moisturizer included in this kit is just not enough. The box indicates that this is a 30-day supply of product, and I can see the other products lasting that long, but the tiny tub of moisturizer which I’m supposed to use twice per day according to the plan in the box, is already half gone after 1 week. The tub should be like 4 times as big to last as long as the other items.Also I am already planning to buy the larger sizes of some of these products, but I’m a little disheartened that those don’t come in much larger packages either. One way to minimize waste and be more environmentally responsible is to offer larger sizes so that people don’t have to re-purchase as often and we use a lot less packaging that way, and it’s also usually more cost-effective for the customer. Great vegan products - just need larger sizes
