cream got hard after about two weeks, only 1/4 of the jar used max before had to throw it away. for a $48 cream to be dispensed in a container unsuitable for the formula is beyond reprehensible. this is a reflection not only on a bad product but on the brand, first and last product from them. ugh. cream got hard, had to throw away.
