So I’ve been using this cleanser for about ten days now and love it. I now have sensitive skin due to my crazy skincare routine during quarantine, which then led to a chemical burn. I now compromised my skin’s barrier. I purchased a “gentle” face wash but little did I realize, it was irritating my skin also. After one wash with YTTP, my skin immediately calmed. I normally don’t spend this much on cleanser, but I really like this and sure it will last a while. Took off a star bc my pump doesn’t work. Yes, sensitive skin safe!
