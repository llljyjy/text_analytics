I really like this face wash it doesn’t have a very strong smell and I was kind of scared to get it because I read some reviews saying that it was really bad for dry skin(which I have) but I still wanted to try it and in my opinion I don’t feel like it drys out my skin it’s a really nice face wash! nan
