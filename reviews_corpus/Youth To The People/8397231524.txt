I have a combination skin which drifts more to dry skin. I always test new cleanser by not applying any skincare products after washing my face to see if it feels tight or gets drier later and this cleanser didnt make my skin dry or oily, no tightness. I washed my face last night and just slept without applying any other thing & in the morning my skin was normal... no dryness.  I had gotten mini size first and then got the bigger size. I am using it for 1 month and so happy. The only thing I was skeptical and I am still now is it has fragrance which I avoid but so far I have not had any issues but would love if they could remove it. non-drying very good cleanser
