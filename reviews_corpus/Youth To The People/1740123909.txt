I think my skin is more reactive to retinal so this wasnâ€™t for me. But potentially if I had stuck with it I may have had better results. Used it once every other day but it caused me to break out. For reference I use superfood cleanser, superfood moisture cream, dream eye cream and superfood exfoliant and all of those products work great for me. nan
