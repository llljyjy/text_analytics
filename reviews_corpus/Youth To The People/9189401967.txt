not amazing but pretty good. ingredients are amazing. love the subtle scent (no actual fragrance but smells so nice and calm?) the texture is lovely but I wish it was more hydrating especially for the price. probably for someone with normal to oily skin not as dehydrated as mine nice but not amazing
