Just finished the YTTP Supferfood Air-whip moisturizer and I loved it! Such a lightweight but super hydrating cream that work well for my combination skin. There’s no scent and it absorbs well. It layered well over any serums I’d apply under it. This is a great moisturizer for maintenance and hydration. nan
