I have combo skin that’s pretty sensitive and easy to mess with, especially when it comes to cleansers. I haven’t had any issues with the cleanser being overly stripping, in fact, I find it to be the opposite. It’s pretty gentle, and non stripping. I do think the price for it is a little much, however, I still think it’s a pretty good. It’s really helped with my acne as well. One of my holy grails!
