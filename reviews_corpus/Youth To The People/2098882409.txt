I have eczema on my face and this product was suggested to me by a Sephora employee who said it was really hydrating as I wanted to try something new as nothing was really working that well for me except La Mer and I cant always afford that. This product is so-so. It feels hydrating but once itâ€™s on the hydration goes away. It is just okay in my opinion. nan
