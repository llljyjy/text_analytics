First impression review (I’ve used the product four times): This Retinal + Niacinamide hasn’t caused any sensitivity, redness, or breakouts so far-that’s a win! I’ve tried retinol in the past that did cause redness and acne, so I’m pleased so far. I can’t wait to see how the product performs over time. First Impression-Awesome!
