I got a sample of this and I really liked the smell and texture. It seemed good based on 1 use, the sample wasn’t very much. So I decided to give it a try and buy the full size, instead of my usual which is Tatcha water cream. I have skin that breaks out regularly if I don’t use an acne fighting cleanser, but is also super dry. After a week of using only this as a moisturizer my face is so dry! it feels like I haven’t used moisturizer in days. It only provides moisture for about an hour. Will not be purchasing again. My skin is all flaky on my cheeks and forehead it’s so dry. Samples should be bigger because it took my skin a week to show true results and now I’m stuck with this full size jar i bought. Not worth tbe money
