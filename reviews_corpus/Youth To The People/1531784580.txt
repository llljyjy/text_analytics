This is a great product that left my skin feeling more hydrated and plump. I received a sample size and tried it out for 2 weeks only with my morning routine to make it last longer. The consistency is light, non-greasy and not heavy or sticky which is nice. My skin absorbed it quickly. The only reason why I wouldn’t give it the full 5 stars is because I was under the impression this was a revamped or better version of their previous Kale + tripeptide 5 vitamin c hyaluronic acid superfood serum. I used to use that serum a couple of years ago and didn’t notice much of a huge difference between the two, perhaps the effects are more apparent if used for more than 2 weeks. Nevertheless it is a great lightweight serum. Instant Hydration
