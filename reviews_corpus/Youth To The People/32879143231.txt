I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks now and I have noticed an improvement in my skin’s texture and redness. My skin has been less irritated. I feel like it’s hard to give a solid review so early in my use, but I believe that over time and consistent use I’ll probably see a lot of benefits. I’ve tried all of YTTP’s moisturizers and the adaptogen moisture cream seems better for my skin type (combo). nan
