This might be my new favorite YTTP moisturizer. I usually do use the superfood cream in the am and the adaptogen cream in the pm but I think Iâ€™m going to switch to this at night and the adaptogen in the am during the dry months. I have very dry skin and this is perfect for intense moisture without the greasy feeling In love!
