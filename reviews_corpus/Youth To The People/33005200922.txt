i loveee this cleanser as someone with really oily skin!!! as a teenager whos constantly breaking out its worth the money. definitely be careful if you’re someone with sensitive skin tho, it did not work out well with my sister. other than that, ever since i started using this regularly it has definitely helped keep my skin in check. I’ve noticed that as long as i use it it the morning and evening, i break out a lot less. the scent isn’t too overpowering either, it smells like what healthy would smell like... its enjoyable and kind of therapeutic holy grail for sure!!
