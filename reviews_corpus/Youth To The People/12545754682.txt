This product would be good for someone looking for a DAY time moisturizer that sits well under makeup. Itâ€™s very light. Honestly I can not tell I am wearing it (good and bad thing) Unfortunately I have combo-dry skin and it just was not thick enough. Has a nice light smell. Will be searching for something thicker and more long-lasting. Not for dry skin types!
