Gosh darn I love this stuff. I have been an EXCLUSIVE Lush skincare user for 9 years and I’ve finally started branching out. This one is one of my favorite cleansers ever!! You’re face feels clean, refreshed, yet hydrated just enough to feel no tightness and smooth as silk; especially after my Farmacy makeup melt away balm! Those two are a winning combo before bed after wearing makeup. I’ve been trying all sorts of cleaners but I find myself going back to this one day and night. I will say I do not JUST use this, I use it as my second wash. I alternate between the first wash and then use this after. But it’s awesome! If you’re more minimal I would still say you could use just this and adore it just the same. I have more oily, terribly acne prone skin that gets red easily and this helps with all of the above. Highly recommend!! FABULOUS cleanser! Fresh, soft and no tightness
