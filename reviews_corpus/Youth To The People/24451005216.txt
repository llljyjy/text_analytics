I really love this mask. I know masks are an unnecessary part of a skincare routine so I consider this to be a luxury product to be used on self-care days. Makes my skin feel incredibly soft and silky the next day. I love the texture as well, it’s very thick and creamy without being greasy. Reminds me of using petrolatum without the grease. It has light fruity fragrance that’s pleasant but definitely unnecessary. Wonderful luxury mask
