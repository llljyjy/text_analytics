I am a big Youth to the People fan so I was thrilled to try this product out. The description - targets hydration, fine lines, adds plumpness to the skin, were all things I look for in my skincare products. Well, this serum did not disappoint! It was so gentle and felt so nice on the skin. No irritation (no fragrance) - which is always a big plus for me! This gave my skin the boost of hydration that it needed, helped smooth out texture and made my fine lines look a little less noticeable. The pump makes application super easy and I love the blue color of the glass. Overall, Iâ€™m a big fan. Want hydrated and glowing skin? Get this serum!
