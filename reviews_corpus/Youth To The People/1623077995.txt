I have oily, acne-prone skin (especially around my period) and in the month I’ve been using this I can tell my skin has improved drastically. I used to have a lot of textures, large pores, acne and acne scarring. Now my skin looks more even and glowy, my period break out was significantly controlled, and I can finally focus on clearing up my scars. I was using the Salicylic acid cleanser from The Inkey List for almost 2 years before this and I realize now it did nothing to help. If you’re like me - give this a shot!! cleared up my oily acne prone skin
