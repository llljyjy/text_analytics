I bought this face wash about 2 weeks ago. And at first I loved the way it made my skin feel but now I’m breaking out really bad which is uncommon for me. I don’t know if my skin is purging since is it a pore minimizer or if I’m having a reaction of some sort. Has anyone else experienced something similar after using this face wash? not a review more of question
