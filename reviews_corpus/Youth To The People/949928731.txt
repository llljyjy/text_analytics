I received this product as a free sample from YTTP but I probably would have purchased this to try anyway.  The Polypeptide cream is great for hydrating and adding a glow to your skin, but it does have a tendency to make my foundation pill up if I let the moisturizer soak in too much.  As for the fine line and wrinkle reduction I have yet to see a change, that being said you really canâ€™t go wrong with any of the YTTP products. nan
