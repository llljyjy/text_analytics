I’m 44 years old, and I don’t suffer from acne. I would say that I have normal skin. It’s not dry or oily, but I cannot tolerate oily, greasy moisturizers on my face at all. They give me pimples. I was looking for a new moisturizer, so I tried this on my hand in the store. It didn’t feel greasy or oily, so I bought it. I used it on my face one time, and it was pretty oily on my face. It was difficult for me to rub it completely into my skin, and I got four pimples the very next morning. Three on my cheeks and one right on my nose. I washed my face the night before, and I only applied this moisturizer. So I know that this caused them. I’ll be returning this for a refund. It’s not for me. Made my face oily and gave me pimples
