Okay so I really like this serum! I’ve never used anything with hyaluronic acid in it, but it’s really helped to control my oily skin (and I have superrrrrrr oily skin; like it drips off my face sometimes). But since I’ve started to use this, my skin has this little glow to it and is not oily at all. Like I’ve never not had oily skin, especially living in Louisiana, I’m so amazed! It’s also helped me realize that my skin was super dehydrated and overcompensating by producing so much oil. 12/10 would recommend! My oily skin is no longer dehydrated!
