I originally purchased this after a very long flight because I noticed my mask irritated my skin due to the dry cabin air from the plane. It was super red and irritated and I couldn’t even wear any makeup without it itching. So I went on the hunt for a mist (of course at Sephora, because duh) and was pretty desperate so I purchased this even though it’s a bit expensive. I sprayed it in my mask for my flight back and my skin had no redness or irritation this time around! I’ve been spraying it in my mask ever since. I’ve also been using it on my face throughout the day and I love how it makes my skin look. Very youthful (I’m 31) & plump. Almost as if I’m wearing makeup & I honestly can’t stop looking at my face after I spray it. It’s definitely expensive *sigh* but i guess you get what you pay for and I don’t think I want to go without it. It’s also worked pretty nicely as a primer for my very natural makeup days. Concealer, bronzer, maybe a tinted moisturizer etc. So here I am, about to purchase another bottle. They got me y’all lol. So beware, don’t try it if you don’t wanna love it. SAVED MY DRY MASK SKIN
