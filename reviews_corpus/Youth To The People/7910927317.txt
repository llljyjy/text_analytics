Definitely a staple in my routine. I tried it for the first time in a Poshmark order and loved it, so I bought it again from Sephora. I have super oily, acne prone skin with a lot of redness but it’s not sensitive. So I can generally try a lot of products without too many issues. I wanted a gentle introduction to AHA’s and I had heard mandelic acid is a great one for acne. This was a great choice. It does take about a week to work but once it does, the results are worth it. It’s a gentle exfoliant that I can use every day to help keep my skin smooth and clear without stripping my skin like the previous BHA toner I was using. Once I started using the Skin Fix acne cleanser and this toner, I started getting so many compliments on my skin. I hope they never stop making this stuff. Worth the Money
