Love this cleanser!! But the travel size bottle is not good. The cap does not tighten all the way so it easily spills when traveling. I’m glad I had mine in a plastic bag, but it still spills all over my other liquid products which was just annoying. Please fix this problem with the cap because I love the cleanser and want a good travel size that I don’t have to worry about traveling with. Great cleanser but travel size cap doesn’t close
