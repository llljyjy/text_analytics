I love this moisturizer!! It’s just so straightforward. I used about a dime-sized smear and it covers my entire face and neck. It’s lightweight so other than feeling the intended benefits of happy, healthy skin, it doesn’t feel like anything’s on my face. It dries down so nicely. Smells good too- there is barely any scent other than a sort of “mmm fresh” smell. This is the only daily moisturizer I’ll use and I’m planning on using it forever! ♡ Ol’ reliable
