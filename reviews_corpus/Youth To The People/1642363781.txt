It’s JUST ok even less than ok. I used it since Jan 11, 2021 until now (April 26) saw no visible signs of improvements. It feels good on, not sticky and didn’t cause any problems for my skin. But it’s super overpriced and I didn’t feel my skin improved. I don’t mind paying a lot IF a product works. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it feels good on like a little moisturizing. But definitely not enough to repurchase! I’m going back to Skinceuticals! They have a B3 serum that works really great. I wanted to give another Youth to the People product a chance because I really liked their clay mask! nan
