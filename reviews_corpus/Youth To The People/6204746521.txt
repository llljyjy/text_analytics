I can’t believe I pay this much for a moisturizer but it really is the best.I’ve tried many that say they deep penetrate, last 12 hours ect. But this is the only one that actually does, at least for me. I put it on over retinol as well, which provides much needed moisture. No annoying smell ! What little scent there is, is very “ingredient smell”  as in an unscented moisturizer way. NO taste, if you accidentally get some on your lips. Do I think it needs to be this pricey?, noBUT props for coming in a glass jar. There are way , way too many pricey items coming in plastic and it just disgusts me. I expect the lush weight of a glass jar ( as well as health/environment reasons) when I pay a certain price. Am I going to purchase again? Yes, unless they change their packaging. Actually worth price
