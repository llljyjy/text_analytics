By happenstance I read the insert that comes with this product. I was shocked to see that the product contains THC. Nowhere on the outside packaging or in any advertisements do they list THC. It is only in the fine print of the insert that nobody reads does it list THC as an ingredient.  This is a problem for me because I get drug tested at work, and I am not allowed to use THC products. That ingredient should be listed more prominently on the product. Also, Sephora should remove products with THC from their Clean at Sephora line because of problems like mine.  Had I have not read the insert that came with the product, I never would have known where my THC exposure came from and never would have been able to argue my case for my work. I would appreciate more transparency. Contains THC
