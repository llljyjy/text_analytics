5 stars times a million. Let me start off by saying I have always had acne prone skin. I did not specialize in skin care rather I looked for anything to get rid of my acne. Iâ€™m embarrassed to say at times I would scrub my face with pure alcohol just out of desperation. This face wash is everything in one. It smells wonderfully, adds moisture to your skin without it being oily, really cleans deep into your pores to minimize texture and pore size, and all in all wonderful to use. I like how much this moisturizer lathers with water and I love the company and what they stand for. I promise you will not be disappointed! just try it and you will be hooked
