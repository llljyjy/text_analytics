The first night I used it, I donâ€™t think I put on a heavy enough moisturizer because my skin was a little dry and flakey the next morning. Since then I have been using it every other night with a thick moisturizer on top. It sinks into the skin really well and has evened my skin tone where I had some post acne pigmentation.
