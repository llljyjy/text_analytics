I’ve been using this product for about a week. This moisturizer is thicker than YTTP’s other moisturizers. But, I don’t find that it’s heavy. It makes my skin feel super smooth and the tiny bumps on my jawline are hardly noticeable. I can’t say that I’ve noticed other benefits yet, but I do really like the smoothing effect it has. nan
