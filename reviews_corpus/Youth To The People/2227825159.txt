I am a month from turning 30 and I was so excited to have a YTTP firming moisturizer with plant based collagen. I basically squeeled when it arrived, perfect timing for me. The smell is mild and thicker then the whipped moisturizer. It made my dead skin shed a tiny bit for a few days but then my skin became even and smoother. I am pleasantly suprised and excited to make this my night cream! ultra moisturizing, perfect for starting my 30â€™s
