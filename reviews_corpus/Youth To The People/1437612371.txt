My review is not incentivized. I have tried several HA serums. My skin is very sensitive. I cannot tolerate many hyaluronic acids (HA). So I eliminated it from my skin care routine. However the clean ingredients in the Triple Peptide+ Cactus + Firming Oasis Serum piqued my interest. THIS IS THE ONLY HA that has not irritated my skin!! I will not spend this much money, but I will splurge for this YTTP Triple Peptide+ Cactus + Firming Oasis Serum. When people are complaining that it is too thick —all you need to do is add some water. I pump 2-3 drops of the YTTP serum on my hand, then spritz a couple pumps of water OR add a drop of water to the serum. Rub my hands together and gently press it to my skin. It is so refreshing. HA cannot work correctly without water. It’s a great product. 10/10 recommend. Amazing Serum!
