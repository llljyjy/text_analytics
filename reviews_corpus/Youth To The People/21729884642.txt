Got the sample size of this in the YTTP set a few weeks ago and ordered the full size during the sale - I love this stuff! It’s really helped with evening out my skin tone and it’s also given me a really nice glow. I think the caffeine really helps with de-puffing, especially under my eyes. The only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because it’s pricey. Please make this more affordable :) nan
