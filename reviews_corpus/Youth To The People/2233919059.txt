I love this resurfacing mask. It’s the best physical + chemical exfoliator on the market. It’s also a true microdermabrasion. It contains high-quality, natural ingredients, & very importantly, it actually works. The results are instantly smooth, texture-free skin. This baby takes off every single dead skin cell. However, even though the physical exfoliants are very fine, they are a bit abrasive [like all microdermabrasions]. If you have sensitive skin, you will experience some redness/flushing afterwards.Keep in mind that this is a well-made product. This is not St. Ives scrub, which literally causes micro-tears in the skin. Yerba Mate is a highly effective + safe product, when used properly. I rotate between this, & my other more gentle exfoliants. I only use Yerba Mate 1-3 times a month. I also always follow up with a very hydrating + moisturizing, barrier-focused skincare routine after using this product. Come next morning, my skin literally GLOWS. The results speak for themselves, & they also last. There are noticeable improvements in both my skin tone + texture with every use.*A tip I learned from a fellow skincare-lover + content creator - Use this product in the shower. The natural heat + steam help to soften up the dead skin cells, making them easier to scrub away. The dampness also helps it to feel less abrasive. SUPER EFFECTIVE - when used properly
