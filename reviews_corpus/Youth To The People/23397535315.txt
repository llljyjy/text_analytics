I am absolutely obsessed with the new Polypeptide-121 Future Cream from Youth To The People. It has a very light and luxurious consistency. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. It never leaves my skin oily or greasy. It instantly adds moisture to my skin and hydrates it greatly. I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost two weeks now and I am genuinely wowed by the results. The fine lines I have on my forehead and under my eyes are fading a lot. I’m extremely grateful for this because they really bother me. My skin looks and feels so much healthier and it is so much more hydrated and moisturized. If you’re looking for a product that will actually reduce the look of fine lines and actually hydrate your skin this is the moisturizer for you! I can’t wait to see how much better my skin looks after using this for even longer. This will actually reduce fine lines!
