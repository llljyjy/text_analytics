I am a huge fan of this face wash overall. I have bought the travel size many times because I can’t not pack this with me when I’m traveling but I am very frustrated with the packaging and may need to find an alternative travel product. The lid often cracks and the bottle almost always leaks leaving a mess everywhere. Poor packaging for a travel product
