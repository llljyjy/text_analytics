I really liked this product - I’ve finished about 3 bottles so far and love using it in the morning after toner. Because it’s so expensive, a little goes a LONG way. My only complaint is how pricey it is considering you only get 1 mL. If you’re on the fence I’d highly suggest getting it because it’s definitely helped with my dark spots recently. My favorite serum!
