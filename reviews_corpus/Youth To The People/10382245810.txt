I love face oils and I have tried alllll the highly rated ones at Sephora and honestly this is my favorite!! I have oily acne prone skin but this actually calms down any acne and helps heal the marks after they’re gone. It gives such a beautiful glow! If I have an event, I mix it with my moisturizer and apply it about an hour before I apply my makeup and everyone asks me who did my make up because it looks airbrushed (and believe me I’m not even that good at makeup). On regular days I apply at night and my skin is so so soft. It doesn’t feel heavy at all, it absorbs so well. The absolute best! BEST Oil!
