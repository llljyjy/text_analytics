This product works really well to make my skin smooth and bright and I have experienced no irritation whatsoever using it 2-3 times per week for the last 2 months. I simply love how it makes my skin look and feel. I wish it didn’t have phenoxyethanol, which is not a clean ingredient, is potentially carcinogenic, and makes me very reluctant to keep using this long term. Another thing is that it definitely stains your face (and hands) yellow, though that part I don’t mind, just putting it out there as an FYI. I put it on several hours before bed and then later follow up with lotion and so far I haven’t experienced my sheets staining. Also handy trick, spray a fine mist of water on your face before putting this on and it spreads much easier. For the time being, I will repurchase, but I will continue to look for a cleaner alternative. Fantastic but wish it didn’t have phenoxyethanol
