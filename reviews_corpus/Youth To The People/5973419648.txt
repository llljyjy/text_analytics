THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE for anyone that lives in cold climates. It is absolutely amazing. I like to try different products and I keep returning back to this one. It is super moisturizing without causing acne (and Iâ€™m acne-prone). Makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Big fan. Also a little pricey, but a little goes a looonnnnnngggg way, so the bottle ends up lasting a long time! nan
