i use this product every other day with my other masks and it takes around 1 and half month to use it all. generally speaking, it is a great product for antioxidant treatment after the explotion by the sun. however i think it is still a bit pricy since it is only 59 ml and only support for less 2 months. Good product but i use it all within 2 months
