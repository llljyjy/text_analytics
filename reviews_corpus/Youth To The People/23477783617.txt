I donâ€™t get acne like I did when I was in my teens and 20s but I do have to wear a respirator mask all day for work which has led to breakouts. I used to use an AHA+BHA pad that prevented breakouts but the glycolic acid was too strong and irritated my skin around my mouth, particularly if I sweated. This one is perfect- I have had no issues with irritation at all. I had bought it on a whim due to great experiences with YTTP moisturizer and cleanser. It wears well under the superfood moisturizer in the morning on the days I work. I really like this combo and will keep wearing it! I do give myself a break on weekends so use it 4-5x a week. I use tretinoin at night without an issue but my skin was already used to that when I started using this toner. Great for preventing maskne
