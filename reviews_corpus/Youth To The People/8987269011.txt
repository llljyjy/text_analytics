I’ve been using this moisturizer for quite some time now. Definitely a favorite. I have extremely dry skin and this works amazing. I also use the Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil on top of the moisturizer when my skin is feeling super dry and they both layer on nicely. Great for sensitive skin. My friend uses this same moisturizer and she has combination skin. So I’d say it’s a very versatile product. Definitely recommend! Go-to Moisturizer
