I use most of the YTTP line up and will definitely keep this around for nights between retinol/other actives. I am super sensitive to smell and this has none. Been using around two weeks every other night, it is really hydrating. To be honest I don’t know if this will do anything else for my skin other than hydration but I’m okay with that! Also put it on before a flight and was amazed my skin was still soft after. nan
