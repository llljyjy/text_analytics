This is a nice thick product that is great for night use. As someone who sometimes struggles with flaky skin patches around their eyes, this prevented that which was great. Other than that, I did not see any huge differences when using this product.I did want to touch on the fact that when you get to the end of the container, the consistency of the product changes into something waxy and not enjoyable to apply.Overall, product is okay - nothing to write home about. nan
