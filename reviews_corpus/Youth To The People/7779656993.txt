The star reduction is more for the pump mechanism than the serum itself -- the serum is good, does the job, but I don’t think it’s worth repurchasing. For how expensive this product is, the packaging should really be better. I like the glass bottle, but the pump gets stuck every time so I have to press down really hard. This causes more product to come out than I want so it feels like I’m wasting it. Also, the cap is literally the thinnest, cheapest plastic I’ve ever seen on a product. Bad packaging, product is fine
