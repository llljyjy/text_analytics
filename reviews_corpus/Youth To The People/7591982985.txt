I’ve been using this cream after cleansing and a hydrating serum and I still feel like it is just not moisturizing enough. It seems to just sink into my skin and disappear, leaving it feeling like I put on nothing at all. I’m trying to use up my jar by mixing a dollop with some squalane oil and that helps but on its own, it does nothing for me. Leaves me feeling dry.
