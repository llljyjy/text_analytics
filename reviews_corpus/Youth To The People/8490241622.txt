I have dry/combo, sensitive & acne-prone skin. I saw this on sale and though to give it a try. I used to use the drunk elephant and the ordinary chemical peel and both burned my skin easily so thought this would be better for my skin type.I’m confused why everyone says this damaged their skin. I followed all the instructions to a tee. First I double cleansed and left my skin slightly damp. Then I applied a thin, even layer.

Then I VERY GENTLY added water and massaged as softly as possible - no pressure applied because I didn’t wanna tear my skin.After about another 2-3 more minutes of massaging, I washed off the mask. My skin was only the tiniest pink since I didn’t apply any pressure when massaging. I made sure to use a wet towel to wipe off the remaining debris. It’s super important to moisturize, so I followed up with summer fridays dream oasis hydration serum + first aid beauty ultra repair cream + the ordinary rose hip oil.The next morning, my texture has definitely improved, and my skin is very plump and bouncy.
