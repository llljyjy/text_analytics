I really like this product. It does hydrate very well and it doesn’t leave me greasy at all! But, I don’t see the firming side of it. I’ve been using this daily for three weeks now. No irritation, redness, stinging, or anything negative caught. I use this with superfood cleanser and moisturizer. Love the hydration without the grease!
