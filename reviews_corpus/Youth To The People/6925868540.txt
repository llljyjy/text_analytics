No change in my skin!  I wanted to try some kind of retinol product to help improve my skin texture and also preventative for fine lines.  I read that retinal is supposed to be more potent than retinol so I was hoping this would be the one for me.  I’ve been using this product consistently for about 4 months now and I see no change.  The morning after J notice my pores look smaller…but after I cleanse and go about my day it’s back to the way it was (blotchy/uneven texture).  Time to hunt for another retinol/retinal product again :( No change in my skin :(
