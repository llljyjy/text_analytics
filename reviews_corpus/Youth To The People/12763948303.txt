I’ve used this cleanser for 5 months now and I can say its worth it. I do have more dry/sensitive skin  (obviously after the first few times of using a new cleanser your skin will “Purge“) purging is normal for every ones skin, when adding a new product. But after 4 nights it was gone and my skin was clear again (purging may take longer to go away because everyone’s skin is different). I use this only at night after I use a cleansing balm or by itself. I can say at least for me, every cleanser I use I do get dry flakes. it doesn’t leave my skin over stripped. I will by buying again...
