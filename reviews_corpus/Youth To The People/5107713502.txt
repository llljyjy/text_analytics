Okay, Iâ€™ll start this review by saying Iâ€™m a huge fan of facial oils, so Iâ€™m picky when it comes to the one Iâ€™ll use in my skincare routine. I was using the $120 Saint Jane beauty oil before this, and was just not impressed enough to keep with it, so I decided to give YTTP a chance. Iâ€™m really glad I did. Thereâ€™s no offensive smell to it, not overly greasy, absorbs into the skin quickly enough but still provides a nice barrier. A little goes a long way, so I think anyone with anything negative to say about this are using entirely too much. Will be purchasing this again, and trying out other YTTP products now! 10/10, highly recommend ðŸ‘Œ New staple in my rotation!
