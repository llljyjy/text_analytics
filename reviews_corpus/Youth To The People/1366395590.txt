I have finished two bottles of this oil and each lasts me a whole year. I don’t use it daily or in the summer, but spring, fall, and winter I use it several times per week at night. It’s great for my normal to dry skin mixed in with moisturizer or on top. It makes my skin glow like no other! The dropper used to be great, but mine has broken like several other reviews mention. YOuth, please please fix this issue!! I can’t travel with the oil now that the cap is broken. Please fix this issue. 5 star product, but please fix dropper
