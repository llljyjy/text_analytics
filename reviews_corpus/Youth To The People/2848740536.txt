I mean I am pretty much YTTP anything because I love the brand so much. But I have tried multiple hyaluronic acid but hands down the oasis serum is the best Iâ€™ve tried. It is so hydrating! My skin was hydrated all day! If your on the fence, just do it. You will not be disappointed. It is worth the buck! The best hyaluronic serum!
