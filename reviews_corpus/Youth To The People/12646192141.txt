Firstly, while I have a glowing review for this product the price is terrifying. Absolutely not budget friendly! :( If you’d like a semi comparable combo you may like the Ordinary Niacinamide then a retinal of your choice! (Paula’s Choice or Inkey List are my recommendations)This stuff is potent but so far incredibly gentle! I feel like this stuff is working overtime on my skin and I’m noticing my skin is much smoother than usual. I don’t notice the yellow cast people are talking about, perhaps they’re using much more product than I am? But you’re not supposed to use a lot of product to begin with when it comes to retinal.  Goes on smooth and layers well under my moisturizer and other serums. My skin hasn’t shown any signs of irritation, which is a rare occurrence when it comes to introducing new products like this!My only problem besides price is the pump came a bit wonky. I have to push a little harder than usual to get the pump to actually go down and produce product. It feels like it’s stuck on something? If you don’t mind the price I absolutely recommend this! nan
