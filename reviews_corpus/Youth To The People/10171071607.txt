My skin becomes irritated with moisturizers, specially ones with fragrances. I have tried many from Sephora. Though Adaptogen Deep Moisture is the first and only one that is soothing for me. While the texture deeply hydrates and smoothens skin, the scent is very natural as the ingredients are from plant extracts (and thus natural). I adore it Amazing for skin sensitivity
