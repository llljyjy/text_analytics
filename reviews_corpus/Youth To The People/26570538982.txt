Amazing moisturizer. My skin is combo, so I have a more oily t zone and a normal to dry cheeks plus acne prone skin. This moisturizer is gel like so it’s perfect for the oilier parts of my face and acne. Skin feels hydrated and healthy. Used the small one from one of the kits and had to buy full size one. It’s also lasts quite a long time. nan
