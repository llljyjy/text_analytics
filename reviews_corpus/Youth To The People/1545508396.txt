I received this product as a sample. There’s probably a good chunk of people who come here to read reviews to check how the product works so I’m giving my honest opinion. BUT, we all have different skin so just relying on reviews is a little risky. Best to use discernment! I have dry, sensitive skin. I’ve used this cream for about a week but I haven’t noticed any drastic changes or any changes to my skin. It’s a good moisturizer and feels nice on my skin but nothing too special. It doesn’t sting and there’s no fragrance so that’s a plus! There’s some great ingredients in here which may be the result of the price point but it’s still pricey especially since I can’t tell what the changes are. Hopefully there’s sample sizes available for anyone whose interested in the near future. A feel good cream
