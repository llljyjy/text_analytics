I have sensitive skin with redness problems and I can use this exfoliant daily without breakouts which I enjoy. I used to use the pixi glow toner but stopped because of everyone saying it had bad ingredients, so I switched to this one. It’s the only other toner I’ve been able to find that doesn’t irritate my skin, but I’ve been using it for two months and haven’t seen any major improvement. My skin is better but I am definitely longing for more. It’s good.
