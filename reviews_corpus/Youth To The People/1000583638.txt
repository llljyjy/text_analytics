Not my favorite clay mask, just didn’t feel like it cleaned my pores out like I do with other clay masks. I did like that it wasn’t drying, I have combination skin, primarily oily on my nose but I use clay masks all over to deep clean my pores so some can make my skin feel too dry later which this one does not. nan
