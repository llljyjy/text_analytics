I love this cleanser, my acne and rosacea was so bad I ended up on the max dose of Accutane for a year. This cleanser has been a holy grail during the time where my skin was the most sensitive. It wonâ€™t take off makeup completely so you do need to double cleanse on those days, but this left my skin feeling clean and hydrated! Great Cleanser!
