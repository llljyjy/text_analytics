Definitely one of my go to cleansers now. I’ve been using it for a little over a month now and I think the pictures speak for themselves. First picture I was using my CeraVe foaming cleaner (teal bottle) and I thought this was the best my skin could get but I was obviously wrong. It was flaky, oily and definitely unbalanced. Second picture is a month and a few days in. I still have blemishes, but they aren’t angry, infected and dry anymore. They heal so fast since using this cleanser as well. I get hormonal acne HORRIBLE and this cleanser along with my SolaWave tool has saved me beyond words. My skin is typically really dry and very oily and now I’m hydrated and glowy. I only got the small bottle and I’m def going to repurchase the big one bc wow. I’m a huge skincare fanatic and I’ve used SO many different cleansers. This is the one. If you’re hesitant, get the small one. But thank me later. Your skin will love you. I also use the ELEMIS superfood AHA cleansing balm beforehand because while this does remove makeup somewhat, it struggles with my mascara. I hope this is helpful! <3Note: I got fillers in my lips, I promise these pics are both me lol!! WOW. WOW. WOW. 100% yes.
