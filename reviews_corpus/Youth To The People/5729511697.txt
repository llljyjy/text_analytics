This is my holy grail face wash!! Love this thing to the moon and back. Havenâ€™t really had any breakouts while using this product( my diet usually influenced my breakouts ) and i recommend this to all my friends. Only problem would be the price but i think it evens out with how well the product has been doing for my skin. The smell is just how you would think it would be and the consistency feels nice before and after you lather your face up. Im not super used to glass bottles for my skincare but i love how earth conscious the company is and how they are trying to have consumers recycle more nan
