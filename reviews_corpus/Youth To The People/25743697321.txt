This cream is honestly amazing! I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect and just used it morning and night through my whole 2 week vacation in Mexico. It made the biggest different as well when I got home and used it given I live in a dry climate.Dewy, light, and a little goes a long way! I would highly recommend, you wake up with lovely skin. Would recommend to anyone!
