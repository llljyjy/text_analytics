i always had troubles using cleansers for oily skin because it always made me dried even though i have really oily skin, but this one is great! it doesnâ€™t make my skin dry at all and it cleans  it really well, since the first use i promise it made my skin so bright! im not even kidding, and it helped with the texture of my skin too! nan
