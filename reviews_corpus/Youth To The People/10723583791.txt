Very drying. Used a.m.& p.m. and left my skin flaky and dried out even with double moisturizing. Discontinuing use for now. Smells good and does lather quite a bit! Do not recommend for dry or combination skin. Weâ€™ll see how long it takes to get back to normal PH, hoping for no breakouts!Kinda pricey for a not so luxurious outcome. Back to CeraVe daily moisture cleanser. very drying product
