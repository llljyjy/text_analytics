Pros: airy texture, earthy scent (almost like fresh cut greens), 2oz of product is solid for the price point, absorbs QUICKCons: Even after the product sunk in, my skin felt like it still needed more hydration. Granted, I have extremely dry skin. Iâ€™d guess this work better for oily/combo skin types. Not for super dry skin
