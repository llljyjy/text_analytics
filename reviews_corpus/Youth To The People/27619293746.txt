I’ve been using this product for about 2 months now, and I’m absolutely obsessed. The scent is stronger than I was used to at first, but it’s honestly really subtle once you’ve used it a few times. I love the way it lathers and how you can use it with varying amounts of water to make the exact lather you prefer for your skin, and as someone with oily and acne prone skin, being able to foam it up in my hands before applying tends to be my preferred way of cleansing. The packaging is lovely, just like with all of this brand’s products, and I will definitely repurchase once my bottle is empty. Great for oily skin, beautiful product.
