This is a very nice cleanser. It lathers/foams up easily, has a nice scent, and feels good on the skin. I would give it 5 stars but I don’t think there’s anything SUPER special about it to warrant the price point. I don’t notice any difference in the look or feel of my skin but it does the job and doesn’t break out my skin. Good cleanser
