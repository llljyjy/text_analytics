I really wanted to like this cleanser because so many people enjoyed it but it just didnâ€™t work out well. Personally, after cleansing my face flaked and felt tight. Along with that the bottle would not stop leaking which was likely a problem with my pump, not an all over manufacturing issue. Anyway, I gave it to my mom to try and she complained of the same problems with her skin feeling tight. I thought for 8 oz you get a lot of product with phenomenal ingredients, but unfortunately I will not be repurchasing this again. Wanted to like :/
