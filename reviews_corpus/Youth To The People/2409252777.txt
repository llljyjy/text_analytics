I really wanted to like this cleanser, after hearing the hype about it. The ingredient list is good but I found it really stripping on my skin. My skin is prone to dryness but this cleanser made me flake up no matter how many hydrating serums and thick creams I used afterwards. I think this cleanser would be better suited to oily or normal skin types. Not for Dry Skin
