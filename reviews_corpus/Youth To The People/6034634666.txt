I rarely write reviews and I really wanted to love this product for the hype but this is the second time I buy this product expecting different results. I have oily skin so dry skin is rarely an issue but immediately after using this product my skin dries out pretty badly, especially around my mouth area. it’s such a bummer but it just doesn’t work for me too drying
