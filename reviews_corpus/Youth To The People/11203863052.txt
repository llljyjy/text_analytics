I read so many great reviews and was so excited for this. It is a good exfoliator (much like the exfolikate) I was not wowed though.  It did make a difference in my skin and with regular use will probably help with dead skin in my pores, however there are other products that are cheaper. See a difference but Not enough to justify price
