YTTP does it again lol. I’ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now (once a week, in evenings) and have noticed a difference in my skin for sure! I was incredibly intimidated because I know retinols (or in this case, retinals!) can be a little intense, but I’m finding it’s not too harsh for my skin when used once a week. My skin feels smoother and looks nice and clear. The product is a neon yellow which was crazy intimidating at first, but it melts nicely into the skin and doesn’t cause any discoloration that I’ve noticed. I follow it up with the oasis serum (another favorite of mine) and a really hydrating moisturizer. Excited to continue using this in my skincare routine! nan
