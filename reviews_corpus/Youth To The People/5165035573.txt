I have very sensitive, acne-prone (hormonal) skin that is a tad red due to my fair complexion. When I put this on the night before I have a beautiful, youthful glow in the morning and my face looks bright and less red! It’s great for my sensitive skin and I’m very pleased. Simple, gentle, and effective!
