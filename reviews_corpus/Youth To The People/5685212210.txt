I have really dry skin that makes my skin over produce oil so Iâ€™m usually nervous to try new products but baaabay, this was really good! I wanted to try this without using any other serums(just in case) I cleansed then layered up with this moisturizer and sunscreen and hunty I was glowing.  My face had a nice shine without looking greasy and it melted into skin like butter. This moisturizer is the BOMB.com
