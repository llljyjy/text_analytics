This is a great HA serum. It’s a nice texture and sinks in pretty quickly. It’s not sticky on my face. It’s hydrating and makes my skin look healthy. Not sure how it compares to others on the market since I typically use serums with other targeted ingredients. Bonus that it’s in a glass container. nan
