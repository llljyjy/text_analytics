I initially REALLY liked this product because it visibly made a big difference on my skin texture and dullness(I looked so fresh-faced and rested!). However, like 3/4 into the bottle I stopped seeing major differences and my skin looked exactly like it had before. I don’t think it’s the product though and might just be my skin (I’m on my 2nd bottle and this one hasn’t made such a big difference). I would still recommend this, but maybe perhaps a sample/mini size first. Good at first… just ok now
