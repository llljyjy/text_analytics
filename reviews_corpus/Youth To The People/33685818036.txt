this cleanser is very gentle and doesn’t make my skin feel squeaky clean (which a cleanser should never do or else its way too harsh!), and smells really good :) its helped clear my skin so much and after a month my skin is clear and my acne scars are fading ! i have oily acne prone sensitive skin and so far i’m loving this cleanser. i bought the mini size in early june and to this day i still have half of the bottle left. i already bought the full size and i truly recommend this to anyone who’s looking for a new face wash or just starting to get into skincare :D saved my skin
