I LOOOOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser! It smells super clean and its very natural. It helped a lot with my acne prone skin and calmed my skin down a LOT! I am sad because my bottle broke after 1 month of using it and I wasted all of my product pretty much so now Iâ€™m going to put it in a plastic bottle from another face wash to prevent that from happening again. I LOOOOVE LOVE LOVE
