When I saw this price tag I was hesitant to try this serum. But Iâ€™m sooo glad I did! This serum has to be one of the best quality serums I have ever tried. It absorbs very well into my dry skin and when I apply moisturizer afterwards it glides like a dream after this product. Just be careful to apply it to a damp face because it does work against you if your face is completely dry. nan
