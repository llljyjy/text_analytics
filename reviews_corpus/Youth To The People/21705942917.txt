This product feels luxurious and goes on nicely over my other YTTP fav the Triple Peptide + Cactus Oasis Serum. It does leave the face a little tacky after application but I can forgive that easily because my skin loves this stuff. In the summer the corners of my lips will often split and this has been helping them heal up very nicely. I canâ€™t conclusively state the long-term benefits after a week but I love this stuff!
