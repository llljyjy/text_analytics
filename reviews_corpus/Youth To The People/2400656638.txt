I really thought I wasn’t like this eye cream. When I initially bought it it was smooth moisturizing I loved it but after a while after dipping my fingers into the jar I feel like it now has a hardness to it so it’s hard to scoop out and when I do scoop some out it’s kind of coagulated. I feel like chunks fall off I feel like I need to rub it between my fingers to warm it up. I would not recommend nor would I buy again little disappointed. Starts great, ends poorly
