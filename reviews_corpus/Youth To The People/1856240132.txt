I wasn’t sure if I’d love this product. I was looking for something soothing, replenishing, but not pore clogging - I’ve only ever experienced this with la mer and augustinus bader. So when I used this on my face, neck, and chest I saw my skin look calmer and hydrated. Even my neck lines diminished. Great for a calming and hydrating cream
