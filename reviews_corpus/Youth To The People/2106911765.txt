This cleanser is my HG. Anytime I stray from it, I always come back. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve repurchased. I have combo skin that gets oily through my T zone. I use tret at night as well. This cleanser keeps my oil under control without over drying my skin. It also helps keep my sebaceous filaments on my nose under control. I can use this year without issue. I recommend this to all of my friends who have combo or oily skin. HG Cleanser!
