I really like this! I have acne prone combo skin and while this is too strong to use twice daily, I use it nightly after oil cleansing to remove makeup and it is a really great clean. If you’re combo like me I recommend to use it once daily and in the morning use some kind of toner, I use micellar water and or a Lush cleanser some days in the mornings instead as they’re not a strong cleanser. But yeah love this honestly, my skin likes it better than the Cerave foaming cleanser (that was too stripping) nan
