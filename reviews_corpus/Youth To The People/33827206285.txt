Newest addition to my skin care routine! This product does take time to see results, so don’t get discouraged. I’ve been using 2-3x/week for a few weeks now and am finally starting to notice a difference in my fine lines and skin tone. I’m excited to keep using it and see what happens after months of consistent use.  Remember to follow up with a moisturizer after applying; I mix 3 drops of the YTTP superberry dream oil into the dream mask and apply to my face after the retinal. Also, Remember to wear sunscreen during the day if you are using retinal!  I didn’t the first time and my face did get slightly sunburnt quicker than usual. nan
