Worth every penny and more I have combination skin that can get really greasy in my T-zone. This evens out the texture and leaves my face so soft and bright. The smell is great and I actually look forward to washing my face, even after a long night out. I know it works because unwittingly I bought this the week before my period started, and while I usually can count on at least 5 new zits, there hasn’t been a single one. If you’re struggling with greasy skin and adult acne, give it a try. Obsessed & in love.
