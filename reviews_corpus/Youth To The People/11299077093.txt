I’m absolutely in love with this cleanser. It was recommended by Arnell Armon I think on either her YouTube or IG, I’m not sure, but I genuinely love it so much. It doesn’t have a strong scent in my opinion to the point where it’s overpowering, but it smells so so good. Another thing I love about it is how it feels on my skin like I can’t recommend this cleanser enough. so lightweight & smells amazing
