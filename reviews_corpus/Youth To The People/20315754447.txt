I’m so glad that YTTP came up with this new formula! I normally use the Adaptogen Deep Moisture Cream which is super hydrating but now that I entered my 30’s, I was looking for something that would help with elasticity and firmness. Luckily, I don’t have any major skin concerns and don’t have a lot of visible fine lines but it’s always good to incorporate something into your routine that is preventative. I really love the consistency of this cream. It’s not thick but it does feel “cushiony” (I think that’s the best word to describe it) and it goes on super smooth. I started applying it to my face and also on my neck. I’ve been using it for a week so far and I already love it! I love that it’s hydrating and doesn’t dry my skin out. I feel like moisturizers from other brands that help with fine lines tend to be a little drying on the face which makes sense because they usually contain strong chemicals. This one feels so natural and it’s fragrance-free which is very important to me. I am definitely seeing a huge difference, especially on my neck which look more firmer and brighter! I will definitely be buying the full size jar! Firmness & Hydration in a Jar
