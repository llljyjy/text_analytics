I have had the Youth to the People Superfood Cleanser for about a year now and decided to try this moisturizer. I have combination skin that can be quite dry at times and was looking for a moisturizer that would be hydrating but not heavy. I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 months now and really enjoy it. This moisturizer is definitely lightweight, absorbs quickly and never feels heavy or sticky on my skin. I have acne prone skin but this moisturizer never broke me out or left me feeling oily. Overall I think this is a great lightweight moisturizer that I would recommend to anyone with combination or oily skin. nan
