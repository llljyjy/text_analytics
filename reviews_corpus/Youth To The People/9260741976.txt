I have used this product a few times a week for about 6 months, and then randomly one day it started immediately burning my face and turning my skin red. I eliminated other products to be sure it was this one causing the burning and swelling. It’s definitely not past it’s shelf life so unsure why this is happening. I read some of the reviews here that lactic acid can irritate the skin, but am unsure why this is happening so suddenly as I’ve had no changes in my skincare routine. Could just be something with my skin and not the product, but unclear. Irritated Skin After 6 Months
