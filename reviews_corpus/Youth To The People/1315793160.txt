Iâ€™ve always been curious to try a retinal but I have really sensitive skin and live in a really sunny part of the country.  I got a sample of this to try and so far have been able to tolerate it with no reaction!  I noticed on the night I used it my face seemed firmer and more glowy.  Looking forward to seeing improved results over time! Great Retinal for Sensitive Skin
