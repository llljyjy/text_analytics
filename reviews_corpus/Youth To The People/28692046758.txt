I was gifted this product for free to try out and give a review. The texture of this cream is not what i expected. It looks like it would be very thick and rich but it turned out to be very light and airy like a gel cream. It applies very smooth and a little goes a long way (I use about a dime sized amount for my face and neck). It absorbs into my skin nicely and makes my skin look and feel more hydrated immediately. I have noticed that my laugh lines and my fine line on my forehead have reduced a bit after using this. Will continue to use this and probably purchase a full size once I run out. nan
