My fave for my dry skin. No alcohol no fragrance. Some people say it smells like ‘socks’?? Lol I smell something faintly but as soon as you spray the smell is gone. I prefer this over fragranced ones that irritate my skin or can produce free radicals in sunlight. Love the sprayer so much. Winter must have nan
