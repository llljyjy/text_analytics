I really dislike this cleanser. I think itâ€™s overhyped. It left my dry skin feeling so tight and way over cleansed. It gave me that extremely shiny finish to my skin after washing, the bad shiny that comes from stripping the skin of natural oils. I tried to use this product for a month or two just to try and get the hype but my skin was always left tight and extremely dry. Absolutely not worth the price. Left me very tight and dry
