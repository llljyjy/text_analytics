I’ve been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare cleanser for over a year, but within the past few months have had some of the worst breakouts that I’ve had since I was a teenager. I decided to give this cleanser a shot to see if maybe changing cleansers would help and the healing that this cleanser did within a week is INCREDIBLE. To preface, I get comedonal acne and I also get cystic pimples (usually related to stress and hormones) and I also have oily skin. So far this month I haven’t had 1 cystic pimple related to hormone changes which never happens and the only skincare change I’ve made is this cleanser and a couple weeks later adding in another YTTP product. This is definitely a new holy grail cleanser for me and I plan to continue repurchasing this whenever I run out. Holy Grail Cleanser
