I didnâ€™t think my skincare routine could get any better and it has with this product. I noticed this product leaving my skin clearer, brighter, and smoother than the previous iteration of the toner. Somebody else who left a review mentioned noticing this 11% toner is less sticky and I notice that too. Overall, and along with many other of the YTTP products, my skin has significantly less redness and irritation in the cheeks that I thought was permanent from sun exposure over my lifetime. I use this product 1-2x a week depending on the dryness of my sensitive skin and in combination with the Superberry dream mask, it restores shine/brightness and removes dullness and texture. Excellent, improved toner
