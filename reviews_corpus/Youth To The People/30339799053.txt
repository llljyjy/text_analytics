This cream has worked wonders on my skin, so Iâ€™m on my second jar despite the price. I had been trying to manage flaking and dryness for a long time using various serums and creams, but I switched to this last year and cut out other actives (since this has vitamin C) and it seems to have solved the problem. I use it every night, and sometimes I pat a bit of squalane oil on top to seal it in (?). Skin is happy and fuss-free, finally. nan
