For some reason my old go to moisturizer started drying out my skin to the point of it being flakey. Thank god I found this because it is the perfect creamy moisturizer for anyone who has issues with dry skin. I will say sometimes it burns when I apply it after using my nightly salicylic acid cleanser but Iâ€™ve never had an actual issue. Leaves my skin soft and glowing every time! Saved my skin this winter...
