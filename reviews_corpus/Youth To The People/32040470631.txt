This serum is godly!!! I purchased this on a whim after needing a serum that targeted hyperpigmentation, and it has done much more than what I bought it for. Whenever I pick at a pimple I put this on and have minimal to no scarring. It brightens my skin and refreshes it in the morning. The smell is fresh and citrusy which is better than other vitamin C serums I’ve tried. It has a thick jelly texture which I don’t mind. The only thing I would change is the pump, it kind of shoots the product out (it works better to put your hand in front of the dispenser rather than below) But overall this product is definitely worth a try. Try it out!!
