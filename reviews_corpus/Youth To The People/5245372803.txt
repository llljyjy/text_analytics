I was a little nervous about trying this at first because it is my first ever retinal product. However, I’m completely blown away! After my first use my skin looked so bright and felt incredibly smooth. I’ve been struggling with balancing my combination skin and this has been my savor. My acne cleared up within a day or two and I don’t feel as dry throughout my day ever since trying this out. I’m a huge fan of all the YTTP products and this one did not disappoint! SO GOOD!
