Firstly, loved the smell of this and found that it removed makeup and sunscreen well. Packaging is nice. However, the texture is too solid and will not emulsify no matter how much you try to warm it up in your hands or rub into your face. Chunks of it just fall into the sink and get wasted. Product seems to be okay in the middle of the jar but gets worse and worse near the sides and bottom of the jar. Wonâ€™t repurchase unless they change the formula. SHE CHUNKY
