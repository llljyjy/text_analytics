I purchased this three times. I rarely purchase a product more than once, so that shows how much I loved it. Very moisturizing, with staying power, and not irritating to my sensitive eyes. I have been looking for an eye cream to replace Kiehls Avocado since I found out they were not cruelty-free, and thought I had with this product. Not sure what happened, but the last one I purchased hardened and became unusable pretty quickly. I tried warming it and mixing the oils but it became gritty. I emailed the company about it but they didn’t respond, which was pretty disappointing. I can’t recommend this anymore. What happened to this?
