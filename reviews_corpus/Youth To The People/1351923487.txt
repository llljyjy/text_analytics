I have tried many of Youth to the People’s other products and liked them all, so I bought the full size of this assuming I would like it also--and if I didn’t, well, it’s a wash-off product, so I could use it up and then switch to something else with little harm done. Big mistake. My skin is pretty resilient--in fact, I can’t remember the last time a product caused a reaction like this--but the Superfood Cleanser gave me a bad case of contact dermatitis. I had scaly, dry patches above and at the corners of my eyes, my eyes themselves were irritated, and I had an itchy rash on my chin and around my nose. It had to be caused by this product, because I introduced nothing else new to my routine. I have to wonder if some of the people in the reviews who say this broke them out also were suffering from contact dermatitis, since sometimes it looks like little whitehead pimples. After a few days of using cortisone cream, my previous First Aid Beauty cleanser, and Cerave and Skinfix moisturizers, my skin is finally doing better, but I feel far more wary about Youth to the People as a brand now. I normally steer away from fragranced products like those by YTP and am put off by brands attempting to make money by using trendy but meaningless terms like “superfood,“ but I gave their products a try because I appreciated the mostly glass packaging, which is more recyclable than plastic. I will use up the YTP products I already own but will think again before buying more. Try the mini size first! Caused contact dermatitis
