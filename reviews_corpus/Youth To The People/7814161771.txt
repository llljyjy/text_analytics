Mixed feelings about this. I had bought this strictly as a first steps in my cleansing routine. I have never used a cleansing balm or oil but was guided to this while in the store. While this takes my makeup off totally, it is hard to get out of the container and crumbles. Doesn’t “milk” very well on my skin, and my skin is so extremely tight and dry after using. Will definitely try something else next time. nan
