I bought this product myself and this review is not sponsored. I started using this serum due to a damaged moisture barrier causing small breakouts and i needed something in addition to my moisturizers and eye cream! I found 3-2 pumps twice daily improved the overall hydration level of my skin. This product also improved my skin texture and clarity, and it feels much more “bouncy“ as advertised. I wouldn’t expect a miracle from this product or any sort of skincare, but I did feel a major difference the past 3 months after adding this product to my routine and I’ve only used a half bottle! My only complaint is the pump seems a little cheap and I can see it having issues dispensing all of the product when you get low. Overall, a definite re-buy that’s worth the price tag! Great for a damaged moisture barrier!
