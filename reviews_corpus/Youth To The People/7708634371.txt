I really want to love this cream. I love the glass bottles YTTP uses. The consistency of this cream is perfect, not too creamy, not too gel-ly. No scent. Absorbs quickly. But...there are just so many irritants, including niacinamide, which I understand is the go to ingredient of the moment, but for those of us with dry, sensitive skin it’s a hard sell when there are other formulations out there that have similar peptide content, but without all the irritants (for about the same price or less!) Even with the irritants the dry/tightness level was still mild and I definitely saw a plumping of fine lines, some softness and glow. So, if you have sensitive skin and you’re down for a little tightness this might work. I think I will hold onto this and use on forehead and smile lines, but won’t repurchase and def can’t use as day/night all over moisturizer. Great Moisturizer, why the irritants?
