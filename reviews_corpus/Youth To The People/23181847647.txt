I wasn’t expecting to like this bc most lightweight moisturizes aren’t actually moisturizing, but this one is! I’m combo-oily and this hydrates my skin without making me oily. It sits well under all the SPFs I’ve tried with it and makeup! It also doesn’t  break me out and I’m very acne prone. I’m pretty impressed and I really like how reliable this is, I could probably even use it in the winter! I do like the scent so that’s not an issue for me, it smells like being outside really early in the morning? Cooling and fresh? Idk but I like it haha. I do think it’s too expensive for the market it’s in so I docked a star for that. It’s actually really good
