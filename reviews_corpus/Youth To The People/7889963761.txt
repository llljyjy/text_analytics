Iâ€™ve been using this face scrub for 3 years. I have tried others in between attempting to duplicate the effects of this scrub only cheaper. Honestly, nothing else compares. This leaves my skin feeling soft, looking refreshed, and has even managed to smooth a few of my crows feet. I love to use it 3xs a week, especially before makeup application. Do yourself a favor and get this. You will never want to be without it. Best On The Market
