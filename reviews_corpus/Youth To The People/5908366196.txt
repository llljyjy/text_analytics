I wanted to love this product. It smells amazing and I love that itâ€™s an overnight mask because having kids means getting creative with self care. It definitely broke me out though in milia type of bumps every time I tried. I tried this is the winter/spring when it was colder. Ended up using it on my neck/chest which was nice. Not an oily gals friend
