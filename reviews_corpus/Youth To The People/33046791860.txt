No moisturizing whatsoever. Was so disappointed. Moreover it’s perfumed so gave me red spots the next day. I was actually surprised that it turned out to be bad because it was an award winning cream with good reviews. But I must say this- that I don’t believe the formula is moisturizing and it’s definitely not worth the price. not for anyone
