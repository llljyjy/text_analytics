I received this as a sample and it exceeded my expectations. I honestly have to say that it is my most favourite hydrating cream I’ve used. A little bit goes a long way, it’s rather thick but runs in easily and smells amazing. I followed the instructions and cleansed my skin before applying, went to sheep and woke up with dewy soft skin that felt much younger! Best hydrating cream ever
