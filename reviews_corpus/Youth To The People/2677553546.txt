I just bought my second tub of this mask. When I first used it, I was on the fence. But after using it about 1x a month for a year, in rotation with my other exfoliating masks, this is one of my favourites. It’s a nice physical exfoliant that leaves me skin refreshed and glowing. I only use an exfoliating mask once a week and this is my only “scrub“ style mask as the others are chemical exfoliants. Be sure not to scrub it into your skin but to gently massage it with circular motions to avoid irritating your skin as to avoid damaging your skin barrier. One of their better products for sure
