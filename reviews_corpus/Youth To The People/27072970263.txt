Honestly I had high hopes for this serum, but it doesn’t live up to the hype. It made my skin texture rougher, which went back to normal when I stopped using the serum. It didn’t absorb well into my skin even after decreasing the amount of products I put in my skincare routine (3 products max) and waiting a long time between each layer. It pilled like crazy so I had to return it. It did gave a nice glow when I applied it but that’s it. Maybe it doesn’t work well on my skin. Pills like crazy
