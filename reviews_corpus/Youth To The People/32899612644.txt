I got this cleanser around a month ago and I have been using it every morning and night before doing my skincare. I got this to replace my clinique cleanser (which was for the dry combination) and it similar in the way how it lathers and gets slightly foamy. I like how this one comes with a pump because for the clinique one I always had to open the cap to use it. Great for sensitive skin
