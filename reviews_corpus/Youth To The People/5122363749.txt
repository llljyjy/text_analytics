Love the product itself but the pump sucks it up when not in use and just slowly leaks it out of the pump spout. Unfortunately I didn’t realize that is what was happening until it was too late to return to Sephora and contacting Youth to the People has gotten me nowhere, such a shame because this is NOT a cheap cleanser yet so much of it is being completely wasted by poor packaging. I guess you could transfer is to a new bottle but you shouldn’t have to do that when you are paying 40 bucks for a face wash. At least one other person has commented about this and there is a reddit thread from like a year ago where people are having this issue, so it’s a long term issue YTTP aren’t solving.
