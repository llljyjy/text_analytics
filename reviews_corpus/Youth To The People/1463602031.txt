I received a free sample of this moisturizer in exchange for my review. I am a big YTTP fan and love their products in general. This peptide cream is not my favorite product yet. The texture is thick and creamy which is nice, and it seems to leave a dewy glow on the skin but it feels a little filmy or sticky. I also donâ€™t love the smell. I have preferred applying it at night vs in the morning because of the weight of it. Of the product selection, I still prefer the air whip or the adaptogen cream for daily use. Not bad, but not my favorite YTTP moisturizer
