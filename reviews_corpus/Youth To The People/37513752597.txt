This is a very nice gel cleanser with an invigorating ‘fresh greens’ kind of scent. I enjoy using this cleanser; it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not overly so – I don’t find it to be drying or stripping. It’s probably my favorite water-based cleanser I’ve tried so far, and now my go-to morning cleanser. You also get a pretty good amount of product with the mini size, which is nice. I purchased the mini size to try it out, but plan to repurchase the full size. my favorite gel cleanser
