Docking one star because this comes with no seal on it and the last jar I got had dried product on the outside of the lid. Not being able to account for any kind of safety (and getting a new jar with dry crusty product on it) is awful. That said, I’ve used this moisturizer off and on for a while and it’s now a permanent part of my routine. I have sensitive (can’t use any silicones or most fragrance), blemish-prone, dehydrated combination skin. I focus my routine around hydration, anti-aging, and blemish prevention, and I’ve also been slowly trying to find places in my routine to cut both unnecessary steps and unnecessary cost. I have a lot of affordable serums/and cleansers I love, but I recently took a break from buying this and tried a less expensive moisturizer with fantastic ingredients. My skin looked duller. I wasn’t having reactive breakouts but I was getting occasional blemishes and texture. It wasn’t unheard of for me but it didn’t look great.I’ve been back on the Adaptogen moisturizer for a week and I just went to put on foundation for a zoom meeting and realized I didn’t need it. My skin is even and glowy, I don’t have a single blemish, and my dehydration lines are plumped out (I was marveling at my smooth forehead in the Zoom screen). I knew this product was good for my skin, but seeing the difference after not using it has sold me. The price is fair for how well it works and it’s an investment I’m happy to make- I just wish they’d put a safety seal for consumers on it.Texture-wise, this is a little thick but isn’t heavy or greasy. I usually mix it with a drop of oil at night and my skin is combo. The Best for my sensitive dehydrated skin
