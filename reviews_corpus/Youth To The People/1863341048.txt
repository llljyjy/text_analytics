This mask is an absolute gem that will be part of my regular rotation for my nighttime skincare routine from now on! It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated. The texture of the mask is incredibly enjoyable and quick to absorbe. My skin felt soft and looked incredible the next morning  Pro tip: a friend suggested I also applied the product on my lips, this is a gamechanger! Don't walk, run!
