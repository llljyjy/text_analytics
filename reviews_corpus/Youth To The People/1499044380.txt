Love this face cleanser!!! I started out with the mini/ travel size. This cleanser DOES NOT dry out my face like others that “suds” up. I was using Ceravè face cleanser because of how gentle it is but this one is just as gentle on my skin so I decided to switch. Definitely a staple in my face care routine
