I bought this in December and have only tried a handful of times. Had suspected that maybe it was causing a breakout of white heads on my cheeks but couldn’t be positive. Most of the time I’d go to sleep right away but tonight I was still up going things and my skin became very irritated and itchy. Washed it off and immediately felt better. I will be skipping this from now . nan
