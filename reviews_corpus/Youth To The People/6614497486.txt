I wanted to like this sooo bad bc the reviews and it smelled really nice- buuuuut after using it for around a month my skin is so dry, irritated, and breaking out really badly for the first time in a couple years!! Before buying it I thought this was in the same realm as a gentle cleanser and it absolutely isn’t.. So fair warning if you have sensitive skin DON’T USE THIS. I don’t think it’s all bad, but it’s not for everyone and definitely not for me. Fair warning to those with sensitive skin…
