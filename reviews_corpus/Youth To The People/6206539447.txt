Overall, I’ve used better eye creams and for the price of this I wouldn’t buy it again. What I dislike about this product is that the lotion doesn’t sink into my skin and doesn’t leave it feeling moist. The product is like a thick body butter and requires rubbing it in to soak in (for delicate under eye you shouldn’t have to rub it in so much). I didn’t feel any added firmness. It’s smooth but I don’t feel like it hydrated my skin. I prefer Kiehl’s avocado eye cream or just using a simple body lotion with HA. Too expensive and didn't work for me
