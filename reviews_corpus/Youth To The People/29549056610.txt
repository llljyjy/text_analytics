This face wash was amazing while I was using it. Very gentle and it always made my face feel clean. My skin didn’t feel stripped but also I could tell that the day was washed away when I would use it. The only reason I’m giving four stars is because of the price. Although I lived this product I wouldn’t repurchase because I can get a drugstore brand that makes my face feel the same way for significantly less money. If I was looking to splurge I would maybe buy this again. Excellent face wash
