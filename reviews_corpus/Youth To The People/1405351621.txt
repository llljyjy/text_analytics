I have oily/hormonally reactive skin. I try to keep up on hydrating my skin as much as possible to keep my barrier intact, and Hyaluronic acid is a must! This serum is light weight and absorbs fairly well, just try not to use too much as it can get sticky. My skin responded so well and feels very smooth! It gets even better with daily use. Fantastic for hydrating oily skin
