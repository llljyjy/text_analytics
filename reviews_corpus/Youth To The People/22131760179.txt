One of the most annoying cleansing balms I’ve ever used... The texture crumbles so much and is difficult to work with. It does melt nicely once you manage to work the product a bit, and smells really good. It doesn’t emulsify much and only does an ok job removing makeup and sunscreen. The most annoying part is that it doesn’t come with a scoop/spatula thing... thankfully I saved mine from the farmacy cleansing balm otherwise I’m not sure how this brand expects people to get the product out of the jar??? Poor decision on their end for sure. Would not repurchase. nan
