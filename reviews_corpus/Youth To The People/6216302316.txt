The texture at first is amazing, and there’s definitely some payoff. I notice my eyes are hydrated and plumper every morning. The downsides have been noted by others - not the best packaging and it dries out over time. It’s definitely frustrating to spend this much on a product when you can only use 2/3 of a not-completely-full package, but it does work well while it lasts. I keep buying it.
