Excellent clean cleanser. Nice level of suds without drying skin. Can remove some makeup that may be lingering after a cleaning balm. Does not trigger breakouts for for dry/combo skin. Biggest negatives of this product are the price tag and leaking bottle (Iâ€™ve bought this multiple times and the bottles always drip). Go To Cleanser
