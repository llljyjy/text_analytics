This lightweight serum definitely packs a hydration punch. I was looking for something new to add to my routine as I have felt drier than usual this winter. I was so delighted to see the Triple Peptide serum launch and immediately picked it up. It absolutely delivered the extra hydration I was looking for but it also gave my skin a lovely glowy finish I was not expecting. Several people commented on my skin looking healthy on days I used it, which was also a surprise.The serum also subtly smoothed my fine lines in only a few weeks and I am so excited to see the results over time. I am super happy with this purchase as it delivered the moisture boost I was looking for and improved the overall quality of my skin. perfect for Winter dryness
