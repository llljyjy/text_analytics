I really enjoy this product. I’ve used one jar and now on my second jar. The package comes in a typical green glass jar with a screw cap. For such lovely ingredients I prefer a pump bottle or a airless jar. The consistency of the formula reminds me of a mixture of Cerave lotion and Tatcha water cream. Like in the middle of those two brands. It has no noticeable scent. The spread of the product is very easy. It’s easy to use too much product then not enough. I use my mini spatula from farmacy to prevent contaminating the product. It sinks into my skin pretty fast and it keeps my face hydrated up 6 or more hours. It leaves a slightly dewy finish but nothing too crazy. It leaves a finish similar to the adaptogen cream by yttp. It plays well with sunscreen (Tatcha silk sunscreen). It also plays well with serums, actives such as bha (Paula’s choice), vitamin c (Paula’s choice vitamin c15 booster)and retinol (yttp retinal).  I don’t wear make up but when I did weather it for an event, I didn’t have issues with make up piling . However my skin tends to be combo dry and acne prone. This does not contribute to any of my breakouts. It works well with my Paula’s choice bha toner. The only two negatives is that I wish for better packing and that I feel like come Chicago winter that this product possibly may not hold moisture and that I will had either add an oil to it or switch out to another moisturizer all together but I’m willing to give it a try come winter.*I’ve purchase this product with my own funds on both occasions* My new Go to
