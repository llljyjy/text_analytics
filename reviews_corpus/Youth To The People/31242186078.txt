This product is so highly recommended that I had to try it. I hate to say this but it irritated my skin. Not only that, but the smell to me is overpowering. The spinach/greens smell is too intense. I would use it if it worked for me, but the irritation obviously just isn’t worth it. Somehow, even when keeping my mouth closed I get this nasty taste in my mouth when using the product. I’ll stick to my aveeno calm and restore cleanser. It’s much cheaper and does a better job for my skin. I’m so disappointed
