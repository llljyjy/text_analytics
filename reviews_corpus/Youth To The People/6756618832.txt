It’s good for it’s price point but not my favorite product. I was a bit caught off guard by the yellowish color but it didn’t really affect my experience with the product. I’ve used this product at least 4 times before writing this review but I’m not seeing any major differences to my skin. It definitely feels good and maybe there are slight differences in my skin but nothing major. nan
