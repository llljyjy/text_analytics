I received this about two weeks ago and have since used twice. Once a week to start it out! I’ll probably up to twice a week soon. I haven’t noticed too much of a difference so early on, but little things like the next day glow and skin softness along with less little break outs. I think it’s a great addition to your routine at the price. Only complaint which YTTP know is it leaves a little yellow residue on your skin that does go away. Just be sure to wash your hands after applying! good serum
