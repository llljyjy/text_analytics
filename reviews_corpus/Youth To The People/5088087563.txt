I received this product as a free travel size for review and I do like it. However, for me personally, I’m not completely sold on it for my skin. I have oily skin and this seems to accentuate the shiny-ness I get most days. I’m late to review because I was very on the fence. But I just don’t know if it works well with my skin, with my skin type and living in a hot and humid state. I feel plenty hydrated at night with the superberry dream mask and during the day with the superfoods whipped moisturizer and I love love love those products for my skin. I’d recommend this product for dry skin, but oily skin people may want to try a sample first. nan
