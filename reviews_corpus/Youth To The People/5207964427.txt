This is the best toner I have tried in ages! I used the Kombucha one first, but it left my skin feeling sticky. This one really gets deep down into my pores without stripping my skin of its natural oils, while clearing breakouts and blemishes. Youth to the People really needs to make a 16 oz bottle of this (like the face wash). Can We Get A Bigger Bottle PLEASE?
