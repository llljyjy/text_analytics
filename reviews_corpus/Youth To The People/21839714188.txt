The reason why I’m rating this 2 stars is because the cleanser isn’t worth the money. It dries the skin out so much that no matter how many layers of lotion I use, my skin just feels so stripped. I actually caused me to break out a bit, but I don’t know if that’s because of the drying effect or an ingredient inside. I think Tatcha and Farmacy do cleansers better for the price Drying
