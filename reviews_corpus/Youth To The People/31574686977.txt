I love that Youth to the People keeps expanding its lineup. Their retinal and niacinamide serum fits well alongside their other products. I have used a few other retinol products, but this one feels great and absorbs quickly. Also, like some of their newer products, this serum is unscented, so it won’t irritate the skin. I probably wouldn’t pay full price for it, but it’s a great serum that I’ve been happy to introduce into my routine. Great Albeit Pricey Serum
