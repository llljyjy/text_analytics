I love that this scrub is a little bit gritty, it feels almost like very fine sand, I have used many exfoliators in the past including tatcha rice polish. This is by far my favourite for these reasons:1. I love the physical scrubbing feeling, and i don’t have to time at all after using this product. Yes, my skin is slightly red immediately after, however you’re stimulating your skin and increasing blood flow when your rubbing this in as a scrub, that’s to be expected. 2. Whenever my skin feels dull or slightly textured this gives me an a nice and refreshing glow, I use it about 1-2x a week and I also apply it to a damp face right after I double cleanse because it is quite thick and can be easier to apply with a little water. 3. Great value! I currently have the mini version of this, and it’s lasted me months, I’m definitely buying the the full sized product. It may seem expensive but I literally use about a pea-sized amount for my entire face and gently work it in. Also keep in mind this isn’t a cleanser, it’s an exfoliator, so you have to cleanse first. I also got a mini version of this product in the gift set of YTTP to try it out first.4. When I use this product in conjunction with the YTTP serums, acai oil and moisturizer (sometimes the keys moisturizer too!) my face never looks better. However I am in my mid 20s and have no acne concerns so I can’t speak to that although I do have sensitive skin and thus far this is great. Anyways hope this review helps some people, if you’re on the fence I’d say try out the value set with all the little minis of YTTP, it’s the same price and all the products are great! BEST EXFOLIATOR!!
