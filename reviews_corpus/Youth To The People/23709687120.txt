I’ve repurchased this maybe 3 times over the past several years since it launched. This is one of the rare moisturizers that actually gives me moisturized skin when I wake up, rather than waking up with dry skin. And amazingly, this works WONDERFULLY under makeup and spf. I apply a tiny amount as a day moisturizer and it’s beautiful. No pilling, no silicones clashing with other products. nan
