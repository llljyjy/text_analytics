Y’all, this mask is amazing. I’ve tried many clay masks from cheap to expensive and this one really clears my skin. I don’t think it “sucks“ the oil out like others do, but I see an effect the next day with overall clearer less congested skin. I always do this mask the night before an event to make sure that my skin looks super flawless. I have oily, sometimes dehydrated skin, super sensitive and reactive (either breakout or get red cheeks) and this does neither. I have never tried combining it with retinol though, can’t speak to that. I also do not slather a thick layer because it takes longer than the 10 min to completely dry. Wish the jar came in plastic for travel but it does feel nice and luxurious otherwise. Worth the Price
