This product is good. But if you like this type of moisturizer (gentle, very hydrating, good for sensitive skin) then please go for the DR. Jart Ceramidin cream instead!! Trust me. They are very similar products (look the same smell the same) but the Dr. Jart is just BETTER. Keeps your skin hydrated much longer and is more gentle. The Adaptogen moisturizer actually makes my sensitive skin a bit red. Dr Jarts does not. Trust me!!! Plus itâ€™s $10 cheaper. Good - But try this instead
