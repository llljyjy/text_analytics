It’s okay, this cleanser has a lot of benefits it seems like but it doesn’t do what I hope a cleanser does which is wash away any and all makeup, oil, dirt I have on my face. This could work with double cleaning (using a cleanser balm and this) but it still doesnt make my face completely clean. I recommend Vanicream Facial Wash (way more affordable as well) :) Doesn’t take off makeup
