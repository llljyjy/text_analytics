I tried this Vitamin C serum after reading that Drunk Elephant C-Firma had been reformulated. Overall, I would not recommend. The pump sticks when you press down on it and dispenses an uneven amount of product each time. The bottle and pump seem very cheap for a $68 item. The serum itself does not glide over the skin easily or sink in well. My least favorite part about this serum, though, is the fact that it pills horribly under moisturizer, sunscreen, and foundation.  I now only use it on days when I know I wonâ€™t be wearing makeup because the pilling is so noticeable.  I did give two stars because I do think my skin is a bit brighter after use, but there are other formulations that are similarly priced that do not have the pilling issue and are not so cheaply constructed. Pilling, poor pump design
