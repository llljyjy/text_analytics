I love this product. Itâ€™s gentle on my rashy skin, and when I have the energy to keep up my skincare routine, this pared with other products seem to help with the rashiness. My issue is with the container it comes in. I love the style of the container, but when the container and contents are in a warm environment (like a hot steamy shower or an non-airconditioned bathroom) the pump acts as a siphon and large amounts of the product are lost overnight. This cleanser is not cheap, and it sucks to lose a third of the product to the shelves in my shower rather than my face. nan
