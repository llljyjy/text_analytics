I absolutely. Love. this serum. I was actually a little nervous to try it because I’ve had bad experiences with the retinol “purge” and all over skin redness and dryness. I’ve been using this for about a week and I have not experienced an initial purge or any skin dryness/redness. I wish I took a before and after because my skin looks so amazing!! This serum so far has helped with redness, acne, and overall texture/tone. I have not noticed any difference with fine lines YET, but I believe that will happen in time. Otherwise this serum is gentle and wonderful. I use it every other night on top of the yttp cactus serum, and use a moisturizer after that. I have extremely fair skin, so it does leave a yellowish cast at first, but it does go away and is never there in the morning. I absolutely plan on buying a full sized bottle after my little baby bottle runs out!! nan
