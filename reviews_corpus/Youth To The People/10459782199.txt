I usually use tretinoin in my nighttime routine but took a break to try out this product and I’m not sure I’m ever going back! Love that it’s all natural and includes niacinamide. Saves me from having to add an extra niacinaminde product into my routine! Youth to the People is really hitting it out of the park with their latest launches. Tretinoin Replacement??
