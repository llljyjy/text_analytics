Tried this prior to the hype and loved it for a couple years. But I stopped using it when I decided to try a different (more affordable) face wash and realized how drying this made my face feel in comparison to the new one I tried. I think this cleanser is a decent one but the Aveeno Oat cleanser works better and is so much more affordable for me at least. nan
