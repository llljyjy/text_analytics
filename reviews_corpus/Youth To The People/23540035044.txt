For someone with sensitive skin, this serum is a great retinol alternative that offers little to no irritation. My skin tone appeared brighter and my skin texture appeared smoother the next morning. Other reviews have mentioned the yellow tint experienced with application of this serum â€” this does not bother me, as all retinol products tend to have a yellow tinge to them and it does not last. Great retinol alternative, little to no irritation
