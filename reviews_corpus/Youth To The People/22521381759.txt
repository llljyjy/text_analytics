I received this as a free trial to test before the official launch date. I was a little hesitant to try it since it is retinol based. That being said, this serum is awesome! It has not irritated my skin in the least. After several applications I can already see a difference in my skin: brighter and smoother. I didnâ€™t know what to expect with this serum, but I absolutely love it. I will definitely be buying a full size when this sample runs out. A+ Serum
