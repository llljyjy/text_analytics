I was going to take a star off for the price, but I’m looking at my skin in the mirror and wow, this is worth every penny! As a long time user of Curology, with my formula containing a different form of vitamin A and niacinimide, I figured I’d give this a shot, as my face seems to have become immune to their product or they changed it. I truly don’t know, but I’ve been looking for something different and I’ve heard great things about retinal compared to retinol. Well, it’s all true. No purging, no flakiness, and this stuff faded a post-acne mark after a few uses. All that being said, I feel obligated to provide a disclaimer stating that my skin is acclimated to vitamin A. Just because I didn’t experience purging or flaking, doesn’t mean that everyone else won’t. However, I actually have experienced both with all other formulations of vitamin A, so I’m thinking this is just a great formula. My skin is clearer, plumper, and as much as I hate when people say this…it’s glowing. As an added bonus, it seems to be keeping my oil production at bay. I have very oily skin and most products leave my face greasy instead of glowing. Not this one though, it’s a keeper. Love this product
