I don’t know if I just got a bad eye cream but..1. it had no protective film upon opening (it 100% should as most products do??)2. it was very hard to apply to my under eyes because of how solidified it got; not creamy at all. 3. The container easily had room for 35% more product. For $48 you’d think they’d at least fill it up. I really wanted to like it. Blehhh
