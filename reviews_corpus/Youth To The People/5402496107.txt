I was gifted this product for my honest review. I have been using it for a couple weeks and I like it- it seems to do a good job hydrating and giving it a nice glow! Since this is 4d HA, it’s supposed to do a better job at deeply hydrating? I cannot confirm nor deny that this has happened to my skin. I have used more affordable HA serums and have been equally happy with the results. I’m not sure the benefits of cactus in skincare so I cannot say if I think this makes the product standout. It is pretty pricy for the small size. I’m still unsure if I would purchase this or not, $54 for a product that imo shouldn’t be more than $30. I personally wouldn’t suggest this to a friend only because the cost. undecided. good but pricy
