this is a very light feeling moisturizer, does the job but took time, good for people like my bf who hates sticky texture of cream but still want something to moisten. this doesnâ€™t have much smell to it but as a beginner level of moisture this is good. use this to build up ur skin care routine and then move up to better things like skin fix or dr jart average
