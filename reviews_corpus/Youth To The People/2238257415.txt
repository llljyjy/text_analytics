I went into a Sephora looking for a tea tree toner when an associate recommended that I try the YTTP Mandelic toner and I have been obsessed with it since. I have oily skin and some products are too harsh. This toner deeps cleans the pores without irritating my skin. I have completely switched over my skincare to YTTP products. Skin Changer
