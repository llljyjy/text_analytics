I love all YTTP products. Even though they sent me the product to review, I really do love it. The consistency is somewhere between the adaptogen cream and the overnight mask. It leaves my skin feeling very supple and that lasts for a long time. I use the Sunday Riley blue tansy oil and I feel like it gets on my pillow when I go to sleep. I started to layer this future cream on top of it and I feel like it creates a nice barrier so that my skin doesnâ€™t feel sticky. Leaves skin feeling very supple
