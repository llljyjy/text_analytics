I’ve been using this serum consistently morning and evening every day for the last few weeks and absolutely love it. Super hydrating, not sticky and absorbs really quickly! I haven’t had any issues with pilling or interactions with other products. I also feel like this has helped protect my moisture barrier as I’ve increased chemical exfoliation recently. Couldn’t recommend more! Hydrating serum of my dreams
