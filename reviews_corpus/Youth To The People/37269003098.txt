It’s now a part of my before bedtime routine. I’ve been using it for about 2 months and honestly my face feels a lot brighter in the morning. My skin is a lot softer too, and it feels hydrated. I was skeptical because of the price, but totally worth it! Love Youth to the People and their clean brand! Love, love, love!
