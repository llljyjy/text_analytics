Saw a bunch of youtubers using this so i decided to give it a shot and wowww its definitely lived ip to its hype. I used to use the drunk elephant cleanser but i felt like it was too expensive for the amount i was getting. This one doesnt dry or strip my skin at all and leaves me feeling smooth. Anyways love this and would highly recommend! nan
