It’s taken me a little while to review this product because I have been nervous to use! I haven’t exactly used any retinal products before, & the yellow color totally made me nervous! But I love how the flyer that came with the product mentioned it’s yellow tone, & to not worry about it because your skin will absorb it! Anyway, needless to say, I finally started to use the product & I truly appreciate the hydration my skin feels when I apply, & how my skin feels & looks the next morning. nan
