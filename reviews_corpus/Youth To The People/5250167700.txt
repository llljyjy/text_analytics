I’ve been using YTTP products since early 2020 and have been impressed with the results. This serum is no different from the other high quality skin care I’ve received from them. The consistency is great, smooths on easily and while it sinks into my pores quickly - it never feels drying or heavy like other serums I’ve tried in the past. And the results are amazing - after following it up with the adaptogene moisture cream,  even my super dry skin is left feeling dewy and fully hydrated for the whole day. I will definitely be adding this to my daily repertoire of skin care products, which is already filled with YTTP products. I have never found a product line that has provided the swift, consistent and lasting results like I have with these. I’m a loyal customer for life. Another winning serum from YTTP
