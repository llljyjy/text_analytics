Giving this 3 stars because this cleanser really gave most areas of my face such a clean/poreless look and feel, but two days after I started using it I started getting patches of what looks like dermatitis around my mouth. At first I thought it was my tretinoin and Azelaic acid so I stopped using them, but it’s been 3 weeks of this now and it’s starting to spread around my nose so I finally went back to figure out the timeline of when I bought this product and when I first noticed the change to my skin which was literally two days later. Going back to Tatcha deep cleanse which was always my holy grail until I decided to try something different :( Really wanted to love this :(
