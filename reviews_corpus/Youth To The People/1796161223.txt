I added the retinal to my routine at night 3x week and the mandelic acid exfoliant to my daily morning routine about two weeks ago and my skin has been looking freshhhh, my forehead lines are disappearing, and my nose pores are reducing. I had tried some of the ordinary (Buffet, Niacinamide, Retinol), cerave (Moisturizer), and mixed in some tatcha (moisturizer, face wash) products for the 4 months before but my skin was feeling out of wack and a mix of dry in areas and oily with huge pores on my nose. YTTP may be pricy but I have yet to find a product from YTTP that doesnâ€™t make my skin visibly look better. My morning routine: face wash, mandelic toner, vit c serum, superfood moisturizer (all YTTP), then sunscreen if I am going outside. My YTTP night routine: face wash, kombucha toner + superberry mask OR retinal + superberry oil OR just the superberry mask. I always use the tatcha kissu lip mask and I wake up soft AF. YTTP is turning back time on my skin
