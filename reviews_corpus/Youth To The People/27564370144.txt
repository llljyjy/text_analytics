This is such a beautiful moisturizer. If you have combo or oily skin, this is great.I do reccomend to pair it with a hylornic acid serum to make sure your skin stays nice and hydrated. It is such a nice texture and leaves your skin looking plump and hydrated. Has no strong smells and is great for sensitive skin. The price is only the downside, but you get what you pay for! nan
