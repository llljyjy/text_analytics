I use this stuff every night before bed and I have no complaints. Specifically if u have dry skin this stuff is for u. I wake up to my skin so nice and soft in morning. It’s not too heavy and has a slight scent when applying but not noticeable when it’s on. For reference I have generally dry, acne prone (this did not clog my pores and/or cause me to break out!!) skin with an oily t zone and forehead. MY GO TO!
