I love the results that this serum has given my skin after a week of use -- I applied it twice during the week, at night, and feel like my face has smoothed and softened in that time. However, the yellow color of the product is very off-putting. I pressed the serum into my fair skin to get it to absorb, but the yellow cast to my skin didnâ€™t go away until I woke up in the morning. My partner said it looked like I had eaten too many mangoes. Great results, but yellow color a turn-off
