I purchased this product to change up from my usual (Biossance Vitamin C, Drunk Elephant C-Firma). The caffeine appealed to me as a way to “wake“ up my skin, however, this made no difference to my skin. It smelled like Coca Cola and had no reduction in my acne scars and pigmentation. I will not be re-purchasing this. Not worth it
