As I get older I’m finding my skin has been changing some. Where I used to have more oily/combo I find my forehead has been more dry than it used to so I tried this in a sample and loved how it balanced out my skin. My forehead is less dry and after I wash I don’t get that super tight feeling that a lot of cleansers tend to give me. This has become my ride or die. excellent face wash
