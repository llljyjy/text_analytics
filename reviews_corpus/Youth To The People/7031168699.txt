I love that this product and company use clean ingredients and protect our environment. However, I have a couple problems with this product. First, it burns the heck out of my eyes when I remove my eye makeup, I’ve tried many cleansing balms and I’ve never experienced this with other balms. I also wish the formula wasn’t quite so thick. I have to use a lot more product than I would normally in order to get it to nicely glide over my skin. It also doesn’t melt very well and is very clumpy. Overall a good product with good ingredients that works well. Just not the best one I’ve tried. Okay, not great
