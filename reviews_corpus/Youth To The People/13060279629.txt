This product is a first good cleanse. I use a spatula (from another cleansing balm) and scrape it out and warm it up in my hands. Then I use on dry skin and it removed all my makeup without leaving my face feeling like I have a residue on it! It removed all my eye makeup and and wasn’t irritating. Overall a very good first step and some thing I’m glad I picked up! one of my favorites
