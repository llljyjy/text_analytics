Very nice product. I received a trial size that I’ve been testing out for a month or two now and my skin feels smoother. My skin was already adjusted to retinol so this did not cause irritation. My one complaint is that the pump on mine didn’t work! But overall a nice product. I use it 2-3 times a week at night Nice Product
