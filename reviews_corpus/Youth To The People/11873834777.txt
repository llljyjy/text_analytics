I absolutely love this product. I have combination skin and have always struggled with finding a good moisturizer that doesn’t make me look shiny or break out. I used to use the Fresh rose moisturizer in the AM and PM, I still do at night but it was too heavy for morning use. I got the smaller sample of this and loved it. My skin felt lighter and cleaner, it was moisturized even though it is the middle of winter. I have been on accutane and it did not irritate my skin. it is also scentless which I like. It overall doesn’t make me greasy throughout the day but still moisturizes super well! I took off one star because of the price. I will purchase the larger size of this but depending on how long it lasts I may need to find another option unfortunately. great but expensive
