Let me tell you....this stuff right here!  This is it!  My skin literally inhales this stuff and after using this product my skin looks bright, tight and glowing. I have been using it twice a day for about 3 weeks and I’m not even halfway through the bottle. One pump is plenty and creates a good lather. I don’t wear makeup often so I can’t honestly comment as to whether its effective at removing makeup products, but it definitely leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed.  This is my new fave and I’m so glad I found it! nan
