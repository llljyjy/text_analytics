A holy grail in my night time routine, I love what a clean product this is from the glass bottle to the simple no perfume smell . I’m 40 yrs old and have combo skin It doesn’t leave my skin dry just clean. I like everything from this brand as you get older you want to invest in skin care that nurtures your skin. Worth it!!!
