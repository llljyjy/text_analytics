I like this serum. It’s not a miracle worker but it’s good. I like that it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tacky at all. But I’m not sure I notice much more hydration than I do with any other serums I’ve tried. To be fair, I don’t use it everyday; maybe only about 3 times a week. If I used it everyday maybe I would notice a difference in my skin’s hydration level. Good but not a miracle worker.
