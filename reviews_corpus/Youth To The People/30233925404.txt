I researched multiple vitamin c serums and decided to try this one. I used it for a few months with no real results. I really wanted to like this! I purchased it at Sephora but couldn’t return it since it was past 60 days. I reached out to the company multiple times, to see if maybe I just got a bad bottle or something (Like I mentioned, I researched a lot and had high hopes for this) they never even replied back. Don’t waste your money!
