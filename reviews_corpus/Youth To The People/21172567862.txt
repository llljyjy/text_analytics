I can’t believe how well this works to hydrate and plump my skin. I’ve noticed a significant reduction in my forehead wrinkles and crows feet - after only a few days. I have combo skin, hasn’t broken me out. And use it twice a day after my toner. I spray my face with water before I apply, find it help adds even more hydration. It’s slightly sticky after you apply but it goes away pretty quickly. No issue layering on other serums and moisturizer on top. Worth the money!! nan
