I’ve been using this mask for 2 months now around 2 times a week. At first I didn’t notice that much of a change but as time went on the bumps and dark spots on my forehead have faded significantly, which has been an issue I’ve been trying to fix for years now. If you have closed comedones I highly recommend this mask, I would use it in moderation though. AMAZING
