Used this retinal serum a few times and I like how my face feels and looks. I was scared to try it due to the yellow color, but once it sinks into the skin, it really does make my face feel smoother and blemishes are looking better/lighter. Think Iâ€™m going to love it long term and keep it in my facial routine. great!
