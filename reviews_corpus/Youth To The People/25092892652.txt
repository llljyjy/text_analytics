I use a lighter weight eye cream in the morning just to help with wrinkles, but I use this one at night so I can work with a richer cream while I sleep. This product is extremely moisturizing and has like a creamy-whipped texture. I have oily skin and this one is a bit more thick than I’d personally prefer, but it works for me and hasn’t caused milia to appear. If you get it around your eyelashes, it’ll look like you have a pale coating of white on them if you manage to get some on your lashes when applying on upper eyelids. Has no noticeable scent either. Will definitely repurchase! Super moisturizing!
