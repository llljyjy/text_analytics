I have mixed feelings about this. It works well with my skin and have noticed my skin is overall calmer but… THE SMELL! It smells like someone walked up and sneezed right on your face. I plug my nose with tissue prior to using and take them out after I’ve applied other products. That cuts down on the smell but it’s still there. I’m on the fence for repurchasing. SMELLS LIKE SNEEZE
