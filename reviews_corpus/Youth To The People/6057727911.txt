Nice product. Helps a decent amount with firming. I would say it neutralizes dullness pretty well. I donâ€™t love the way it feels or goes on. Not a very sensual part of skincare routine, which is something I personally look for. If you like something quick that you almost forget you put on, this is for you. Good, but not for me
