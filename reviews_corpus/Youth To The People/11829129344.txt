(I received this product as a free sample)I was really excited to try this moisturiser and from only two weeks of use, I’ve noticed my skin become more even and glowy. It truly is fragrance-free as advertised and the texture feels great on my skin. I have oily skin so I was worried it would be too heavy for the hot summer days but it doesn’t feel heavy and doesn’t leave my skin congested. I want to give it 5 stars but the price for the amount you receive isn’t worth it to me—if you already have a polypeptide cream or a collagen cream that you know and love then I would stick to it. This is definitely a product I would only splurge on for my birthday or ask for Christmas. nan
