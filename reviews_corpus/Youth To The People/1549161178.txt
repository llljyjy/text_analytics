I’m 38 and have tried just about every brand of skincare there is, even la mer and Rodan and Fields. I just received this and I’m OBSESSED. My skin INSTANTLY feels velvety smooth and has an amazing glow! I never leave reviews, partly because I’m lazy but also because there hasn’t been a product that I’ve felt was sooooo awesome I just had to leave a review. Price point is on higher end but they are environmentally conscious, with high quality, recyclable packaging which adds to cost I’m sure. I hope they’d consider lowering their price just so more people can try it! Love love love INSTANT results
