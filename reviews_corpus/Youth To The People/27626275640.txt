Not bad, but I prefer a tube or pump rather than having to stick my fingers into the jar every time. The consistency of the cream is nice, I feel like it doesn’t make my face too oily, although it seems kind of thick for day time use. I can’t say that I’ve noticed my face being firmer as I already use retinal which aids in firming as well. If you don’t mind creams in a jar, this one was ok, nothing special. nan
