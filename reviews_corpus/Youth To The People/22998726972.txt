I have been using this for about a week now and I am so happy with it! When I first used it I was a little concerned about the color as it is a very bright yellow but once I rubbed it in I didn’t notice a yellow tint or anything on my face. The smell isn’t too harsh it quickly faded once rubbed in. I really love the texture this cream left on my face, it was tacky at all and once I put a moisturizer on after it left my face feeling very soft. Since it has only been a week I haven’t seen major changes but I think my skin looks smoother over all and I am excited to continue to use this product and see what it can do! nan
