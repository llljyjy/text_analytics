I love this cleanser. I have oily, acne-prone skin. for me this is great! I used to wet my face and leave my hands wet, and then apply the cleaner. this creates a lot of bubbles. so now, I wet my face, dry my hands, grab the cleanser and then apply to a wet face and it changed everything! I have way more control of the cleanser. very gentle scent, leaves my face feeling clean, soft and doesnâ€™t make me feel like my skin is stripped of all of its oils! love this one. simply good!
