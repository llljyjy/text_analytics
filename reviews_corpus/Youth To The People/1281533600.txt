Fragrance free. Works well with my serums and retinol at night (Curology). Doesn’t pill, which is a major plus! It’s not as hydrating as I would like. Perfect for daytime, especially when layering with spf and makeup, if you would like. I have combo oily skin. So I love a thick moisturizer for night time, so this doesn’t do it for me. Overall, still a great product, if you’re looking for a lightweight moisturizer. I love all things YTTP, however this wouldn’t be on my list to purchase. Lightweight Moisturizer
