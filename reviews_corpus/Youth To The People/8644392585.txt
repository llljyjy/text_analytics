Works really well for oily skin! If you have dry skin or even combination I might skip on this. Even my super oily skin has to get used this face wash because of how powerful it was. Took a star off because I didnâ€™t even get to the second use of this product before the pump broke and I have spent about 2 months pouring the product out each time I want to use it. great for oily skin
