I enjoy this moisturizer pretty well since I’m on the drier side. A little goes a long way otherwise it could feel a little sticky. My skin looks smoother when I wake up, but it could also be from my actives that I use along with it. I’m on the hunt for the perfect moisturizer, hopefully this is the one! nan
