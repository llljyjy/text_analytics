I love this cleanser! I have tried so many over the years and I would put this in the top 5% I’ve tried. It’s not a makeup remover, you need to use something additional for that but it gives a really great clean without feeling like your skin has been stripped. The smell isn’t my favourite but it does smell very “natural”. I’ll be repurchasing! nan
