I really wanted to love this product because I love the cleanser but it just doesn’t work for my skin. I broke out after one use (but kept trying it because since my skin is sensitive I thought maybe the change was causing the breakouts) but it didn’t work for me. I had to use quite a lot of product to feel hydrated enough and even then after a few hours my face was so greasy as if my skin was over producing oils because I wasn’t getting the hydration I needed. I have never had dry skin so this was a weird experience for me. Not worth it?
