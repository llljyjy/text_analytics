This is a great mandelic acid toner. I tried a little sample bottle and I saw great results within a few uses. It was not irritating on the skin, it even says on the bottle that it is suitable for everyday use, but I haven’t used it everyday, I rotated it with other toners in my night time routine. You really do see a difference the next morning, the skin is plump and over time there is improvement in texture. I highly recommend this. Although The ordinary’s mandelic acid is great too and I like it a lot, but if you want to try some other mandelic acid product, then this YTTP toner is a great option. nan
