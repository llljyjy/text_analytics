I really like this moisture cream. It delivers enough moisture for my skin while not being too heavy. I’ve been using it morning and night and makes my fine lines less noticeable- especially on my neck (I’m 48) Bonus that it is made with clean ingredients. Love Youth to the People! great moisturizer
