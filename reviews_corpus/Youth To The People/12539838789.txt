Really impressed with this serum! YTTP always delivers! This serum goes on super nice and doesn’t feel drying or too intense. I started off using it once a week and removed harsh exfoliants! I’ve now up-ed to twice a week and can already see amazing results! My skin looks brighter and can definitely see my tone and texture become more even!!! Was nervous to implement anti-aging ingredients like Retinal but I’ve had no breakouts or bad reactions! Can’t wait to see results after longer use! Great way to implement anti-aging!!!
