I’ve used this product three times now, once each week since I got it. I think I will try going up to 2 days next week, as it’s not drying my skin….I like it a lot more than any other retinol I’ve tried so far. I make sure to use a moisturizing serum both before and after this serum to keep dryness at bay. nan
