I tend toward drier, reactive skin, and have really liked YTTP’s deep cream moisturizer. Late this spring and into the summer, which has been warmer and more humid than the previous few years, I was noticing an increase in breakouts and a heaviness to the deep cream moisturizer. I decided to switch to this moisturizer for the summer, and it seems to be a better fit for my skin with the heat and humidity. I’ll stick to the deep cream moisturizer for the drier, colder months and harsh Minnesota winters. My primary criticism of this moisturizer is the strong scent. Good for summer
