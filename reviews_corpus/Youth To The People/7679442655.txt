i really like this product, it leaves my skin feeling soft and with a nice minimal glow. tbh i didn’t like it at first because it left me feeling tight, if you’re also experiencing this i recommend to use something hydrating before this. it’s a moisturizer so if your skin is dry before it’ll still feel dry after (a hydrating mist is what i like to use!) if you’re combo/dry this is definitely not the product you’d want if you’re minimal and just cleanse and apply cream. good product!
