I had very uneven texture and uneven skin tone. I used this on partly dry and sensitive skin and had enough hydration. If you use this on mature dry skin it won’t work as well. Also, it evens out  tone! I had never seen a moisturizer that evened out my pigmentation and texture! Whiteheads, sun damage, etc, I’m on my third jar already! Evens out tone and texture
