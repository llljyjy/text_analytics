This product it self is beautiful, the packaging and everything and I believe it was over hyped. I thought I enjoyed this cleanser up until it was drying my skin out so much that it started flaking and i have an oily T-zone! It made my skin 10x more oily due to the fact that it was stripping off my natural oils. I went back to my original cleanser, nothing wrong with it I just wanted to try something new, but will continue to use my tarte rainforest of the sea cleanser its the best for oily skin. Drying even for oily skin
