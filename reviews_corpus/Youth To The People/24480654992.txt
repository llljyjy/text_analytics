I had a small container of this and liked it. I felt like it left my skin clean and residue free. So I bought the 8 ounce size. First, the pump wouldnâ€™t work, and I was going to return it. It functioned as a mediocre cleanser for a while. I was away from home for a while and came back to see that the remaining cleanser leaked out of the spout and emptied itself. nan
