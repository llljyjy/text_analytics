Bought this on the reccomendation of a friend who’s face was looking radiant. It’s not bad, but nothing amazing. I don’t think it did anything to enhance my skin. It also didn’t break me out. It’s a good, safe, general moisturizer that I wouldn’t re-purchase due to the price tag. Decent moisturizer, not worth the price
