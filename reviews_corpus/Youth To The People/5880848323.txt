I am so pumped the yttp made a vitamin A serum! I have been dying to try one out but with my very sensitive and reactive skin I was afraid of how other company products may affect my skin. But this product is great! I use it every 3-4 days since I am new to it, and I wake up with smooth, plump, healthy looking skin. I have had no problems with the yellow hue of the product and my skin has had no adverse reaction to it! I have enjoyed it so much that I am purchasing the full size! nan
