Such an amazing product! I’ve been trying to find a good cleanser for my sensitive, acne prone skin for so long. Finally tried this one and can’t get enough! I struggle with bad acne, redness, and pores… this hits all those targets. I have combo skin and it helps with my oils and acne without drying out the skin. A nice glass bottle with a pump, easy to use, and smells amazing. My skin loves this product and I will continue to repurchase! nan
