I bought this cleanser because it was recommended to me by a friend who also has dry skin like myself. After the first few uses I didn’t notice anything wrong with the cleanser but as time went on it dried up my face like crazy! And broke me out. I typically use the first aid beauty cleanser and had no issues. I also find after cleansing with this and using a cotton pad with toner after I’m finding that it does not remove dirt/oil from the face. It’s honestly influenced hyped up, mid cleanser. nan
