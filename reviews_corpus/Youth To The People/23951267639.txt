My most repurchased skincare product so far! Did wonders on my skin. YTTP uses a more potent form of vitamin C so you wonâ€™t see the product oxidise over time or cause irritation. Instead it leaves your skin very soft and the caffeine helps reducing dramatically your blemishes. After testing more than 20 vitamin C serums, this one has became my holy grail!!! nan
