I’ve never written a Sephora review before. But this cleanser is incredible. It’s the best I’ve ever had. I love how gentle yet cleansing it is. Not harsh, clean ingredients. It’s amazing. I’ve turned a bunch of my friends onto it also. Also, the bottle looks beautiful on a counter which is a huge plus :) nan
