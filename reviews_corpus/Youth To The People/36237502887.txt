I love this oil! I use this whenever my face feels extra dry and it always gives that extra boost of moisture I need. I usually mix a couple drops in with my moisturizer to use (a little goes a long way.) Although it is pricey, I think it is worth a splurge if you have dry skin like me. A worthy splurge.
