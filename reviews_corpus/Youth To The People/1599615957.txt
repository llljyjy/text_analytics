Sinks in quickly but leaves my skin feeling plump and moisturized all day. No irritation thus far (I’ve been using ~one week). Pairs well with other products (no pilling.) It seems gentler than DE protini peptide serum/cream combo, but I haven’t been using it long enough to judge with brand is more effective. So far, texturally and in terms of moisture this seems like a solid choice for my normal/dry skin. So far, so good!
