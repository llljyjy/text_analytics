So here are the pro’s: it smells great, it emulsified well and it leaves skin feel soft and hydrated. All of that can’t make up for how it’s too thick, melts really slowly and a bit chunky. Farmacy Green Clean is much better in my opinion if you’re looking for something that has all the same pro’s but also melts easily to a think texture and doesn’t have any chunky bits. Not for me...
