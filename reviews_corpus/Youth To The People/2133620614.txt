After using this product for the last few weeks, I’m disappointed to report that I believe it was the source of my new breakouts :( looking to up my skincare game, I changed around a couple of my products. I thought i was just going through a “purge” but the minor breakouts kept coming (usually have relatively clear skin with maybe a couple zits a month, but was noticing multiple per week). I changed back to my cerave cleanser and the breakouts almost immediately stopped. I’m surprised and don’t know what exactly about this product was causing them. Hope this review helps! Disappointed!
