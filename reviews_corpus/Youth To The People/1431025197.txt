This moisturizer strikes the perfect balance of nourishing without feeling heavy, dewy without looking greasy, and effective without interfering with any of my other products. I can even layer it underneath sunscreen without pilling! I especially love using this before & after applying my Rx retinoid. It also works well as an eye cream! Definitely a multi-tasking formula thatâ€™s versatile in terms of who can use & how to use. Multi-Talented Moisturizer!
