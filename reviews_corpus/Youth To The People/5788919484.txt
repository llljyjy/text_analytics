Best Vit C serum I’ve tried, not sticky, nor does it leave a weird smell like some of the others I’ve tried.  Helped almost completely clear up my mascne (and i’m a nurse who works in a mask 40-50 hrs a week).  Instruction say 2-3 pumps I believe but more often than not I only need one to cover my whole face MAX 2, which makes it last longer. 100% will be buying again and again. Awesome serum, helped clear mascne!
