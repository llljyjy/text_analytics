this is the only fave wash i’ve bought more than once.  i got my grandma to use this and even she loves it.  i got it in trading product after not having it for a while and i can’t believe i ever stopped using it.  my skin is acne prone and some cleansers make my skin feel stripped but this one leaves me feeling clean but not dry.  this is my go to recommendation for clients who want a good all around cleanser. nan
