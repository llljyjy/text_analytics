This product did not work well for me, but still giving it 4 stars because I believe it would work really well with dry skin. The good: after applying this the night before, my skin in the morning was supple and glowing. The bad: the product is too rich and oily for combo skin. It does not absorb well into my skin which causes an oily feel and residue (but considering this is a sleep mask, I guess it’s not so huge a deal). The dealbreaker, however, was because it was so rich, it was causing congestion with more small bumps and texture. Oily and combo steer clear, but dry and very dry this one’s for you! Not for me, but good for dry skin
