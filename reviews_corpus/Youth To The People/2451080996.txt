I love the way this serum feels! I’m able to use it about four times a week without irritation but I suggest starting off slowly- maybe 1x a week then every other night.It absorbs beautifully and my skin instantly feels hydrated and looks smoother. Can’t wait to see the results I get as I continue to use it. YTTP does it again!
