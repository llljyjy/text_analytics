Today is the fourth day of using this cream. I’m applying it in the morning and at night. It is so moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. It sinks right in. I’m happy that it is fragrance free. I’m in my 60’s so I like using a cream that will help with fine lines and firmness. I’ve been using YTTP products for about 2 years now. I love everything!! So moisturizing!!
