I have super sensitive and fair skin, and I’m often dried out by the end of the day. I use this to help gently remove my face of makeup and LOVE this product. It’s a bit dense but just massaging it with your fingers in circles on your face helps it melt everything away. Super gentle, hydrating, and one of my favorite YTTP procure I’ve purchased. Would recommend! Love this gentle cleanser!!
