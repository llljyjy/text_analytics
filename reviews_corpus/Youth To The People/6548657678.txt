my aging, still slightly oily in spots skin sent me on a skincare adventure and this cleanser was by far the best. I tried low- & high-end brands, and even Clinique wasn’t working for me anymore. I use this morning & night (when I don’t skip the routine) and stopped breaking out in the oily spots while not turning red my drier cheeks & forehead. good stuff! perfect for combo skin
