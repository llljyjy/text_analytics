This mask/moisturizer is my go to for my nighttime routine (I have dry skin). I love that it’s on the thicker side and feels very moisturizing. It also completely melts into my skin and feels so luxurious. I don’t use this with makeup or sunscreen since it’s specifically a night time product and I feel like it really locks in my hyaluronic acid serum and my retinol that I use before applying this. Have been using it for a year and don’t plan on switching it up any time soon! Nighttime Go-To
