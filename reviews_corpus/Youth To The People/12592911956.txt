it’s a little too thick to use every day because it tends to break me out, but if you use it 2-3 times a weak it’s a fantastic product. intensely hydrating, gives you a beautiful glow the next day, and has a nice smell. because of how rich it is a little definitely goes a long way. on my second jar great once in a while treatment
