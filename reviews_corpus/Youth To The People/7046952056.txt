I went into Sephora, needing a new facial cleanser. Something gentile enough for twice a day, cleans deep, yet not stripping, doesn’t aggravate my acne flareups, and works on middle aged skin. My former cleanser was discontinued and replace with some thing horrific. I couldn’t believe how much I love this. It does everything I need the price is decent. I think the smell is just what these super food ingredients smell like without masking agents or fragrances. It’s simple, clean, and fresh, and doesn’t linger. It doesn’t trigger my migraines. It is in a glass bottle, so it’s useless for the shower, but I carry a squirt in on my face scrubber. nan
