Very disappointed with the mini version. There was barely any product in the jar. It was very thick and dried out unlike their full size, which I absolutely loved. The consistency in their 59ml jar is very lightweight, great for sensitive combo skin and a little goes a long way with this moisturizer. Not sure if I just got a really bad batch for the mini version. Different consistency from the 59ml jar
