i was gifted this cleanser and after using it for ~ 2 weeks i’m in love! i have quite hardy skin, and this cleanser leaves my skin so soft after i use it, even before i put on my moisturizer.  it works great as a second cleanse as well! i’m usually not a fan of scented products, but this cleanser has a really gentle fragrance that hasn’t irritated me. as someone with oily/combo skin, this cleanser has been great to keep my skin moisturized during canadian winters, and i’m interested to see how it will affect my skin in the summertime. for now though, i’m absolutely in love! in love
