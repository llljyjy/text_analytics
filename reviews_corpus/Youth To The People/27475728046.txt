I’ve been debating on splurging on this cleanser for over 2 years, I finally just made the purchase and I kid you not, I regret not buying it two years ago when the thoughts came into mind. My skin feels so plump and hydrated after washing my face, it’s truly the best cleanser out there worth the price tag
