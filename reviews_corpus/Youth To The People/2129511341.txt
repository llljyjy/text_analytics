I wanted to love this product. the first few days it worked well but I noticed a small red rash forming. Turns out I am allergic to something in this (I think the cactus) because as soon as I stopped using this, my rash went away. The first few days before the rash formed, I loved it. Just wish it worked better for me Allergic Reaction?
