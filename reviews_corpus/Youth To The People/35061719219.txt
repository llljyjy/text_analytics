I bought this product to use specifically to help with the pores on my nose. I do use it all over my face, which has helped a lot with dryness. When I first used this, my skin was so hydrated and smooth afterwards, which is why I fell in love with this product. I do not use this to take off makeup. I focus a lot on my nose when Iâ€™m massaging in this product, and have noticed a difference in my pores, as they are smaller and less noticeable. Overall, this product feels great and leaves me feeling refreshed. Great for your nose!
