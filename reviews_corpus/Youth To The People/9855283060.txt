Bought this cleanser for the first time last year and when I tell you I cried after each month, believe me. I have struggled with facial cleansers since my acne started in 5th grade. There was always 1 wrong reaction and 2 things that were average beneficial. This cleanser Calms, hydrates and for the first time unproblematically cleans my skin. The container is a clean, minimalist and esthetically pleasing glass. The scent is not overpowering and smells natural and fresh. And a half pump washes my face and neck so it last forever with me.Simple yet luxurious. The favorite child of my skin care routine
