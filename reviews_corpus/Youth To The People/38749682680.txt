This is not my favorite cleanser ever. It kind of leaves my skin dry and tight afterwards (and I have really oily skin). It didn’t really help prevent any breakouts for me, if anything it might’ve been the cause for some. I do enjoy the gel-like texture of it and it lathers up nicely on the skin (in a way where it doesn’t create huge suds but just nice small foam bubbles). It smells clean/refreshing. The packaging is super sleek. That’s pretty much all I have to say about it though. not my fav cleanser
