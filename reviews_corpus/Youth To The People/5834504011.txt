This cleansing balm has completely changed how I take off my makeup. It makes it so easy for me to remove my makeup and I no longer dread the process. I does leave that kind of film over my eyes but I always go in with a second gentle cleanser and once I have done that there is no trace of that film. It is super gentle and does not dry out my skin either. nan
