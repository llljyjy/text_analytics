This moisturizer is AMAZING!!!! Probably one of my favorites moisturizers. It’s very light weight but packs a lunch in terms of hydration and moisturizer. I’m a very naturally “hot” person so even if my skin is very dry I can’t use heavy products or I’ll sweat it all off. This product is perfect. Its also not that expensive considering a little bit of product goes a VERY long way. I’ve had my 2 oz jar for three months so far and I’ve used it every night since I got it, and I haven’t even made a dent in the amount of product in the tub. It’s still 9/10 full so it’s lasting a long time. nan
