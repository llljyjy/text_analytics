My skin doesn’t absorb this oil and doesn’t feel hydrated. It is still dry despite applying generous amount in layers. Also, it makes me break out and darkens my skin. It does the opposite to giving me a glow. I will use the remaining on my body and won’t be purchasing again. I don’t understand how it can have such nice reviews. I have sensitive & dry skin in the winter. After readings the comments, I thought this would solve my dry skin problem and give me a glow. I know have 10ish pimples and my skin is still dry. I’ve been using for three weeks. I will stop now and continue my quest for a hydrating cream. I give up on the oils. It does not quench the skin. This one gave me painful breakouts. One was very painful and will leave a dark spot for several months. If you have sensitive, rich brown skin & dry skin, don’t buy. I drink plenty of water and eats a balanced diet. I just need my skin to be hydrated in the harsh cold months of the Canadian winter, not break m out with dark scars. Horrible! instead of a glow and hydrated skin, I got pimples
