I really love this product! It is very easy to apply to the face and doesnâ€™t usually pill when used with my other products. It is scented, but it actually is a pretty light scent and it smells good. I would recommend to only use this as a night time moisturizer if you are more on the normal to oily side, since it is a pretty heavy product. The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because of how heavy it is. SO WORTH IT!!
