I love this stuff. I find cleansing balms usually very thick and pore clogging. This becomes a super thin oil and it really takes everything off. I’ve tested it by going over it with a micellar water and the pad was completely clean! It’s very easy to rinse off and doesn’t leave a residue. I haven’t tried enough balms to tell you if it’s the best, but it surely works well! nan
