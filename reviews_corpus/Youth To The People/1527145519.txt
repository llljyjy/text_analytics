I’ve kept this mask around and after trying a few others, I repurchased this one and will stick with it. It’s gentle but effective and all the other more potent masks burned my skin but that doesn’t happen with this one, regardless of how often I use it. Everytime my skin starts acting up, I use this and it calms my skin overnight and I see great improvements the next day. This is the perfect clay mask for sensitive skin and people who have issues with clay masks being too strong. Gentle but effective
