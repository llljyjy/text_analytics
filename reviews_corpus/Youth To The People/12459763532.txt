I honestly have a combination type skin. My goals is to always be able to hydrate my skin. With this mask, when I used it, created rashes and acne to sprout up, making my skin itchy. But I noticed that maybe I don’t know how to wear the mask the right way. I wasn’t sure if I needed to moisturize first, or cleanse the skin and then put it on, I don’t know, maybe that’s why my skin reacted in a bad way. Good,but not for me
