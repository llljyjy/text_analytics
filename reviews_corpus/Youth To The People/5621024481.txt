So I first got this because I have combo skin and I thought it would be a nice addition to my winter night time routine, and at first my skin was dewy, it calmed my rosacea, everything was fantastic...until I started breaking out. I noticed more and more that my skin was no longer reacting well to this product and I started to break out. The product after the first couple days was starting to sit on top of my skin and never quite sink in the way it had, and I think this was clogging my pores and causing a tonne of congestion. I love this line, but for me this product is an absolute no go. I could see this being a holy grail for someone with extremely dry skin but for everyone else, buyer beware! ONLY for VERY dry skin, not normal, not combo, DRY
