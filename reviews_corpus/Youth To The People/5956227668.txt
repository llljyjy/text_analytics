Moisturizes really well and makes my face plump and glowy. I’ve also noticed a reduction in pores. Goes great under makeup, I don’t even need a primer these days. I love the ingredients - I’ve been looking for a good polypeptide cream but didn’t like the DE one, so I’m happy YTTP came out with this one. I only deducted 1 star because I have to be extra careful how much I apply - if I apply a little too much it doesn’t sink fully into my skin and leaves a greasy sheen on my forehead. For reference my skin type is normal/slightly oily. Idk what ingredient it is that doesn’t sink in fully, but it leaves a sheen. Which is nice for some parts of your face but not your forehead lol. I’ll still keep buying tho and just use less so it absorbs more fully. A chickpea sized amount is good for my entire face so this jar will last you a while. Overall I think it’s worth it for $83CDN. my new HG moisturizer
