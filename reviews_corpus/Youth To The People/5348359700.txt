I‘ve been using this product for a month now. It definitely brightens my skin, but I haven’t used it long enough to notice my dark spots fading. My biggest problem with this product is that it PILLS SO MUCH! Even if I use one pump for my whole face or apply it to my face differently, it will always pill. It’s even more noticeable when I’m wearing makeup! My whole face will pill when I take my makeup off, this has never happened before, not until I started using this product.I’m going to finish this product up but don’t see myself repurchasing it in the future It Pills!!!
