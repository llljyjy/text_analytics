This is very very effective and I love the ingredients. Half way through the bottle and I have noticed a huge different in my pores and skin texture. I am not exaggerating, this is legit. I also have had no issues mixing with my other skin care - including other acids and retinol. However I am going to switch to using this in the morning followed by my vitamin C serum which YTTP says is all good. Two more bottle in my cart as I type. LOVE and will forever repurchase ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE
