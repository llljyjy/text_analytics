I love a good clay mask for oil control and a deep clean.  It’s summer and humid so my skin can feel pretty congested.  I alternate this mask with others but this is definitely my favorite clay mask.  It clears out all the junk in your pores and when I rinse I feel like my skin can breathe (is that makes sense).  Also, I feel it’s important to mention this mask doesn’t dry uncomfortably hard on your skin and it rinses off pretty easily. nan
