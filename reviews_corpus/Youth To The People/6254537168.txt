I don’t get the hype around this product since it didn’t do much for my sensitive skin. The fragrance is too much for my sensitive nose to bear. If you’re using this cleasner be sure to remove your makeup with micellar water first before washing your face because it doesn’t do a great job doing that. I believe that I’m better off using drugstore cleansers with salicylic acid. Overrated scented cleasner
