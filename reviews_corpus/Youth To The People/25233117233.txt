You can’t go wrong with anything that’s YTTP . The polypeptide-121 future cream is just what my skin has been missing. After using the product for only two days I have noticed a difference, my skin is more moisturized and appears tighter. I don’t much care for the smell and it’s a lot thicker than the Air whipped moisturizer (My fav) but doesn’t feel heavy on my face. All in all an amazing product. Can’t go wrong with this one
