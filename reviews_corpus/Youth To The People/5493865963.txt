This serum is absolutely incredible - absorbs well, not sticky, and is like a big glass of water for your skin. I have seen major improvements in my hydration levels and overall skin tone since starting to use this three weeks ago. The only complaint I would have is in regards to the pump - you have to push down quite hard on it which makes the serum fly out. Please never discontinue this product! Saving Dry Skin!
