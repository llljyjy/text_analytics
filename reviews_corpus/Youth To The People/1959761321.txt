I am a forever fan of Y2TP skincare and when I got the chance to try out this product I jumped on it. Replacing my normal moisturizer with this one for the week I noticed a dewiness and evenness that I hadnâ€™t had before. My skin feels glowy and soft, I will be replacing my Adaptogen moisturizer with this one when I finish it. The perfect moisturizer!
