This may be the cleanser I use for the rest of my life.  I have always had super sensitive skin when it comes to face wash and this doesn’t stink, irritate or dry my face out at all.  I always get red rashes around my eye whenever I use another wash but never with this stuff.  I know others have had different experiences since everyone’s skin is different, but I highly recommend at least giving this product a try! nan
